\"http://api.shuffler.fm/v1/channels/artist:%22Weird%20Al%22%20Yankovic?api-key=<api-key>\", \"id\": 125944, \"biography\": [\"alfred matthew \\\"weird al\\\" yankovic (pronunciation: /\\u02c8j\\u00e6\\u014bk\\u0259v\\u026ak/; born october 23, 1959) is an american singer-songwriter, music producer, accordionist, actor, comedian, writer, satirist, and parodist. yankovic is known for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2007), recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows. his works have earned him three grammy awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the united states. yankovic's first top ten billboard album (straight outta lynwood) and single (\\\"white & nerdy\\\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. he directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists including ben folds, hanson, black crowes, and the presidents of the united states of america. in addition to recording his albums, yankovic wrote and starred in the film, uhf, and television show, the weird al show. he has also made guest appearances on many television shows, in addition to starring in al tv specials on mtv. \\n\\nearly life:\\nalfred was born in downey, california, and raised in the town of lynwood. he is the only child of nick louis yankovic (june 4, 1917 - april 9, 2004) and mary elizabeth (n\\u00e9e vivalda; february 7, 1923 - april 9, 2004). his father was born in kansas city, kansas of yugoslavian descent, and began living in california after serving during world war ii; he believed \\\"the key to success\\\" was \\\"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\\\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. nick yankovic married mary elizabeth vivalda in 1949. mary, who was of italian and english descent, and had come to california from kentucky, gave birth to alfred ten years later. al's first accordion lesson, which sparked his career in music, was on the day before his sixth birthday. a door-to-door salesman traveling through lynwood offered the yankovic parents a choice of accordion or guitar lessons at a local music school. yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over guitar was \\\"they figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing yankovic in the world\\\", referring to frankie yankovic, to whom he is not related directly. yankovic said that \\\"his parents chose the accordion because they were convinced it would revolutionize rock.\\\" he continued lessons at the school for three years before continuing to learn on his own. yankovic's early accordion role models include frankie yankovic and myron floren (the accordionist on the lawrence welk show). in the 1970s, yankovic was a big fan of elton john and claims john's goodbye yellow brick road album \\\"was partly how i learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion.\\\" as for his influences in comedic and parody music, yankovic lists artists including tom lehrer, stan freberg, spike jones, allan sherman, shel silverstein and frank zappa \\\"and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the dr. demento radio show.\\\" other sources of inspiration for his comedy come from mad magazine,monty python, and the zucker, abrahams and zucker parody movies. yankovic began kindergarten a year earlier than most children, and he skipped the second grade. \\\"my classmates seemed to think i was some kind of rocket scientist so i was labeled a nerd early on\\\", he recalls. as his unusual schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates, yankovic was not interested in sports or social events at school. he was valedictorian of his senior class. yankovic was active in his school's extracurricular programs, including the national forensic league, a play based upon rebel without a cause, the yearbook (for which he wrote most of the captions), and the volcano worshippers club, \\\"which did absolutely nothing. we started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook.\\\" yankovic attended california polytechnic state university in san luis obispo where he earned a degree in architecture. \\n\\ncareer:\\n\\ndr. demento and early fame:\\nyankovic received his first exposure via southern california and syndicated comedy radio personality dr. demento's radio show, saying \\\"if there hadn't been a dr. demento, i'd probably have a real job now.\\\" in 1976, dr. demento spoke at yankovic's school where the then 16 year old yankovic gave him a homemade tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in yankovic's bedroom into a \\\"cheesy little tape recorder\\\". the tape's first song was \\\"belvedere cruisin'\\\", about his family's plymouth belvedere, was played on demento's comedy radio show, launching yankovic's career. demento said \\\"'belvedere cruising' might not have been the very best song i ever heard, but it had some clever lines ... i put the tape on the air immediately.\\\". yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, saying: \\nit was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe dan fogelbergs. they'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. and i would get up with my accordion and play the theme from 2001. and people were kind of shocked that i would be disrupting their mellow thursday night folk fest. \\nduring yankovic's sophomore year as an architecture student at cal poly at san luis obispo, he became a disc jockey at the university's radio station, kcpr. yankovic said he had been nicknamed weird al by fellow students and \\\"took it on professionally\\\" as his persona for the station. in 1978, he released his first recording (as alfred yankovic), \\\"take me down\\\", on the lp, slo grown, as a benefit for the economic opportunity commission of san luis obispo county. the song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as bubblegum alley and the fountain toilets at the madonna inn. in mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \\\"my sharona\\\" by the knack was on the charts and yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station (to take advantage of the echo chamber acoustics) and recorded a parody titled \\\"my bologna\\\". he sent it to dr. demento, who played it to good response from listeners. yankovic met the knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \\\"my bologna\\\". the knack's lead singer, doug fieger, said he liked the song and suggested that capitol records vice president rupert perry release it as a single. \\\"my bologna\\\" was released as a single with \\\"school cafeteria\\\" as its b-side, and the label gave yankovic a six-month recording contract. yankovic, who was \\\"only getting average grades\\\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music. on september 14, 1980, yankovic was a guest on the dr. demento show, where he was to record a new parody live. the song was called \\\"another one rides the bus\\\", a parody of queen's hit, \\\"another one bites the dust\\\". while practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met jon \\\"bermuda\\\" schwartz, who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on yankovic's accordion case to help yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. they rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began. \\\"another one rides the bus\\\" became so popular that yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on the tomorrow show (april 21, 1981) with tom snyder. on the show, yankovic played his accordion, and again, schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects. \\n\\nband and fame:\\n1981 brought yankovic on tour for the first time as part of dr. demento's stage show. his stage act in a phoenix, arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager jay levey, who was \\\"blown away\\\". levey asked yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. yankovic admitted that he had, so levey held auditions. steve jay became yankovic's bass player, and jay's friend jim west played guitar. schwartz continued on drums. yankovic's first show with his new band was on march 31, 1982. several days later, yankovic and his band were the opening act for missing persons. yankovic recorded \\\"i love rocky road\\\", (a parody of \\\"i love rock 'n' roll\\\" as recorded by joan jett and the blackhearts) which was produced by rick derringer, in 1982. the song was a hit on top 40 radio, leading to yankovic's signing with scotti brothers records. in 1983, yankovic's first self-titled album was released on scotti bros. he released his second album \\\"weird al\\\" yankovic in 3-d in 1984. the first single \\\"eat it\\\", a parody of the michael jackson song \\\"beat it\\\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of jackson's \\\"beat it\\\" music video, and what yankovic described as his \\\"uncanny resemblance\\\" to jackson. peaking at number 12 on the billboard hot 100 on april 14, 1984, \\\"eat it\\\" remained yankovic's highest-charting single until \\\"white & nerdy\\\" placed at number 9 in october 2006. in 1985, yankovic co-wrote and starred in a mockumentary of his own life titled the compleat al, which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. the movie also featured some clips from yankovic's trip to japan and some clips from the al tv specials. the compleat al was co-directed by jay levey, who would direct uhf four years later. also released around the same time as the compleat al was the authorized al, a biographical book based on the film. the book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents. yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for the monkees in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of north america. yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with the monkees, despite the fact \\\"the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money.\\\" yankovic also appeared on the wendy carlos recording of prokofiev's \\\"peter and the wolf\\\" as the narrator in 1988. the album also included a sequel of camille saint-sa\\u00ebns's composition the carnival of the animals titled the \\\"carnival of the animals part ii\\\", with yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of ogden nash, who had written humorous poems for the original. rub\\u00e9n valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts. a factual biographical booklet of yankovic's life, written by dr. demento, was released with the 1994 box set compilation permanent record: al in the box. the dr. demento society, which issues yearly christmas re-releases of material from dr. demento's basement tapes, often includes unreleased tracks from yankovic's vaults, such as \\\"pacman\\\", \\\"it's still billy joel to me\\\" or the live version of \\\"school cafeteria\\\". \\n\\nnew look and career to present:\\n\\non january 24, 1998, yankovic had lasik eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia. when running with scissors debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically-changed look. in addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair. he had previously shaved his mustache in 1983 for the video of \\\"ricky\\\" to resemble desi arnaz, and 1996 for the \\\"amish paradise\\\" video. yankovic reasoned, \\\"if madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, i figure i should be good for a change at least once every 20 years.\\\" he parodied the reaction to this \\\"new look\\\" in a commercial for his nonexistent mtv unplugged special. the commercial featured yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for hanson's \\\"river\\\", claiming his new look was an attempt to \\\"get back to the core of what i'm all about\\\", that being \\\"the music\\\". three of his latest albums feature the longest songs yankovic has ever released. the \\\"albuquerque\\\" track from running with scissors is 11 minutes and 23 seconds; \\\"genius in france\\\" from poodle hat runs for 8 minutes and 56 seconds; \\\"trapped in the drive-thru\\\" from straight outta lynwood is 10 minutes and 53 seconds long. before 2007 (apart from a one-off performance of \\\"albuquerque\\\" in albuquerque, new mexico), these \\\"epic\\\" songs were not performed live in their entirety due to their length and complexity. (see live performances for details) yankovic has also started to explore digital distribution of his songs. on october 7, 2008, yankovic released to the itunes store \\\"whatever you like\\\", a parody of the t.i. song of the same title, which yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that \\\"i don't have to wait around while my songs get old and dated--i can get them out on the internet almost immediately.\\\" in 2009, yankovic released four more songs: \\\"craigslist\\\" on june 16, \\\"skipper dan\\\" on july 14, \\\"cnr\\\" on august 4, and \\\"ringtone\\\" on august 25. these five digitally released songs were packaged as a digital ep titled internet leaks, with \\\"whatever you like\\\" retroactively included in the set. in 2011, yankovic completed his thirteenth studio album. this album, titled alpocalypse, is his first studio album since straight outta lynwood, and was released on june 21, 2011. the album contains the five songs from the previous internet leaks digital download release, a polka medley called \\\"polka face\\\", a song called \\\"tmz\\\" for which bill plympton created an animated music video, and five other new songs. yankovic had reported an interest in parodying lady gaga's material, and on april 20 announced that he had written and recorded a parody of \\\"born this way\\\" titled \\\"perform this way\\\", to be the lead single for his new album. however, upon first submitting it to lady gaga's manager for approval (which yankovic does as a courtesy), he was not given permission to release it commercially. as he had previously done under similar circumstances (with his parody of james blunt's \\\"you're beautiful\\\"), yankovic then released the song for free on the internet. soon afterwards, gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client, and upon seeing it online, lady gaga granted permission for the parody. yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the human rights campaign, to support the human rights themes of the original song. yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual independent music awards to support independent artists' careers. \\n\\npersonal life:\\nyankovic married suzanne krajewski in 2001; their daughter, nina, was born in 2003. they also have a pet cockatiel named bo veaner and dog named bambu. they used to have a pet poodle, named bela (pictured atop yankovic's head on the cover of his album, poodle hat). yankovic identifies as christian and has stated that a couple from his church appeared on the cover of poodle hat. yankovic changed his diet to become a vegan in 1992, after a former girlfriend gave him the book diet for a new america and he felt \\\"it made ... a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet.\\\" when asked how he can \\\"rationalize\\\" performing at events such as the great american rib cook-off when he is a vegan, he replied, \\\"the same way i can rationalize playing at a college even though i'm not a student anymore.\\\" in 2004, yankovic's parents were found dead in their fallbrook, california, home, apparently the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace that had been recently lit. the flue was closed, which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house, suffocating them. several hours after his wife notified him of his parents' death, yankovic went on with his concert in mankato, minnesota, saying that \\\"since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well\\\" and that it would \\\"at least ... give me a break from sobbing all the time.\\\" although yankovic played the concert as planned, a scheduled meet and greet following the concert was canceled. \\n\\nmusic career:\\nwhile yankovic's song parodies (such as \\\"eat it\\\") have resulted in success on the billboard charts (see list of singles by \\\"weird al\\\" yankovic), he recorded an equally large number of original humorous songs (\\\"you don't love me anymore\\\" and \\\"one more minute\\\"). his work depends largely on the satirizing of popular culture, including television (see the tv album), movies (\\\"the saga begins\\\"), food (see the food album), popular music (\\\"bohemian polka\\\", \\\"polkarama\\\"), and sometimes issues in contemporary news (\\\"headline news\\\"). yankovic claims he has no intention of writing \\\"serious\\\" music. in his reasoning, \\\"there's enough people that do unfunny music. i'll leave the serious stuff to paris hilton and kevin federline.\\\" although many of yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. most yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was \\\"smells like nirvana\\\", which references unintelligible lyrics in nirvana's \\\"smells like teen spirit\\\". other satirical songs include \\\"achy breaky song\\\", which refers to the song \\\"achy breaky heart\\\", \\\"(this song's just) six words long\\\", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in \\\"got my mind set on you\\\", the unreleased \\\"it's still billy joel to me\\\", and perform this way\\\", set to lady gaga's \\\"born this way\\\". yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs \\\"amish paradise\\\", \\\"white & nerdy\\\", and \\\"you're pitiful\\\"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clich\\u00e9s (such as \\\"ebay\\\" and \\\"don't download this song\\\"). yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for \\\"legal and personal reasons\\\", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans. there exists, however, one exception to this rule in the case of \\\"like a surgeon\\\". madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when yankovic was going to turn her \\\"like a virgin\\\" into \\\"like a surgeon\\\". madonna's friend was a mutual friend of yankovic's manager, jay levey, and eventually yankovic himself heard the story from levey. unlike other parody artists such as allan sherman, yankovic strives to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original. while sherman reproduced them orchestrally, yankovic and his band essentially play the original song with new lyrics. instead of using instrumental versions of the original songs, yankovic and his band transcribe the original song by ear and re-record the song for yankovic's parody version. sometimes artists whose work yankovic parodies perform on the recordings,i.e. dire straits members mark knopfler and guy fletcher perform on yankovic's parody of dire straits' \\\"money for nothing\\\" and \\\"money for nothing/beverly hillbillies*\\\". yankovic also includes a medley of various songs on most albums, each one reinterpreted as a polka, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was \\\"...the way god intended\\\". because the polkas have become a staple of yankovic's albums, he has said he tries to include one on each album because \\\"fans would be rioting in the streets, i think, if i didn't do a polka medley.\\\" some of yankovic's original songs are \\\"style parodies\\\" for which he chooses a band's entire body of work to honor/parody, rather than any single hit by that band. such bands include rage against the machine with \\\"i'll sue ya\\\" (which features many aspects of the hit song \\\"killing in the name\\\"), devo with \\\"dare to be stupid\\\", talking heads with \\\"dog eat dog\\\", frank zappa with \\\"genius in france\\\", nine inch nails with \\\"germs\\\", and queen with \\\"ringtone\\\". others are style parodies in the style of a genre of music, rather than a specific band (for example, country music with \\\"good enough for now\\\" and charity records with \\\"don't download this song\\\"). yankovic has contributed original songs to several films (\\\"this is the life\\\" from johnny dangerously; \\\"polkamon\\\" from the movie pok\\u00e9mon: the movie 2000, and a parody of the james bond title sequence in spy hard), in addition to his own film, uhf. other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as \\\"dare to be stupid\\\" in the transformers: the movie. one of yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number 27. it is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for running with scissors, poodle hat and straight outta lynwood. he had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers. he explains that \\\"it's just a number i started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to.\\\" other recurring jokes revolve around the names bob (the al tv interviews often mention the name, and a song called \\\"bob\\\" is featured on poodle hat), frank (e.g. \\\"frank's 2000\\\" tv\\\"), and the surname \\\"finkelstein\\\" (e.g. the music video for \\\"i lost on jeopardy\\\", or fran drescher's character, pamela finkelstein, in uhf). also, a hamster called harvey the wonder hamster is a recurring character in the weird al show and the al tv specials, as well as the subject of an original song on alapalooza. other recurring jokes include yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. in a number of al tv interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. this motif also occurs in \\\"why does this always happen to me?\\\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. this also appears in numerous al tv interviews as well as in several of his songs (\\\"albuquerque\\\" and \\\"wanna b ur lovr\\\" to name a few.) yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \\\"shave his back for a nickel.\\\" this also appears in the song \\\"albuquerque\\\". yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs. the first, in \\\"nature trail to hell\\\", said \\\"satan eats cheez whiz\\\"; the second, in \\\"i remember larry\\\", said \\\"wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\\\" yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \\\"mainstream\\\" parody targets, such as toni basil, mc hammer, and men without hats. yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \\\"white & nerdy\\\" and album straight outta lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music. \\n\\nmusic videos:\\nwhile yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part. most notably, the video for \\\"smells like nirvana\\\" uses an extremely similar set to nirvana's \\\"smells like teen spirit\\\", including using several of the same actors. this video contended with \\\"smells like teen spirit\\\" at the 1992 mtv video music awards for best male video. other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include \\\"eat it\\\", \\\"fat\\\", \\\"money for nothing/beverly hillbillies*\\\", \\\"bedrock anthem\\\", \\\"headline news\\\", \\\"it's all about the pentiums\\\", \\\"amish paradise\\\", \\\"like a surgeon\\\", and \\\"white & nerdy\\\". the video for \\\"dare to be stupid\\\" is, as stated by yankovic, a style parody in general of devo videos. several videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to yankovic and his band. dr. demento appeared in several of yankovic's earlier videos, such as \\\"i love rocky road\\\" and \\\"ricky\\\". actor dick van patten is featured in both \\\"smells like nirvana\\\" and \\\"bedrock anthem\\\"; drew carey, emo philips and phil lamarr appeared in \\\"it's all about the pentiums\\\"; keegan-michael key, jordan peele, donny osmond, judy tenuta and seth green appeared in \\\"white & nerdy\\\"; and ruth buzzi and pat boone appeared in \\\"gump\\\". the video for \\\"i lost on jeopardy\\\" includes an appearance by greg kihn, the artist whose song, \\\"jeopardy\\\", was being parodied, along with don pardo and art fleming, jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. florence henderson played yankovic's amish wife in \\\"amish paradise\\\". while most videos that yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as mtv and vh1, yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. the dualdisc version of straight outta lynwood features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by bill plympton and john kricfalusi; one video, \\\"weasel stomping day\\\" was created by the producers of the show robot chicken, and aired as a segment of that program. as of fall 2010, yankovic is again collaborating with bill plympton to create a video for a new song (\\\"tmz\\\") which will appear on his upcoming album. \\n\\nreactions from original artists:\\nunder the \\\"fair use\\\" provision of u.s. copyright law, affirmed by the united states supreme court, one does not need permission to record a parody. however, as a personal rule, and as a means of maintaining good relationships within the music community, yankovic has always requested permission from the original artist before recording his parodies. he claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for parody permission deny his requests. also, according to stanford libraries, fair use is unlikely to justify a parody song that parodies more than a few lines of song lyrics from an existing song.  positive michael jackson was a big fan of yankovic, and yankovic claimed jackson \\\"had always been very supportive\\\" of his work. jackson twice allowed him to parody his songs (\\\"beat it\\\" and \\\"bad\\\" became \\\"eat it\\\" and \\\"fat\\\", respectively). when jackson granted yankovic permission to do \\\"fat\\\", jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own \\\"badder\\\" video from the moonwalker video. though jackson allowed \\\"eat it\\\" and \\\"fat\\\", he requested that yankovic not record a parody of \\\"black or white\\\", titled \\\"snack all night\\\", because he felt the message was too important. this refusal, coming shortly after the commercial failure of yankovic's movie uhf in theaters, had initially set yankovic back; he later recognized this as a critical time, as in searching for new parodies, he came across nirvana and leading to a revitalization of his career with \\\"smells like nirvana\\\". yankovic has performed a concert-only parody \\\"snack all night\\\" in some of his live shows. yankovic had a cameo appearance, along with many other celebrities, in jackson's music video for \\\"liberian girl\\\". \\n\\ndave grohl of nirvana said that the band felt they had \\\"made it\\\" after yankovic recorded \\\"smells like nirvana\\\", a parody of the grunge band's smash hit, \\\"smells like teen spirit\\\". on his behind the music special, yankovic stated that when he called nirvana frontman kurt cobain to ask if he could parody the song, cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, \\\"um... it's not gonna be about food, is it?\\\" yankovic responded with, \\\"no, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics.\\\" according to members of nirvana interviewed for behind the music, when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. additionally, cobain described yankovic as \\\"a musical genius\\\". mark knopfler approved yankovic's parody of the dire straits song \\\"money for nothing\\\" for use in the film uhf on the provision that knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled \\\"money for nothing/beverly hillbillies*\\\". yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the dvd audio commentary for uhf, explaining \\\"we had to name that song 'money for nothing 'slash' beverly hillbillies 'asterisk' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. those wacky lawyers! what ya gonna do?\\\" the permanent record: al in the box booklet referred to the song's \\\"compound fracture of a title.\\\" when a fan asked about the song's title, yankovic shared his feelings on the title, replying \\\"that incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. i'm not sure why, and i've obviously never been very happy about it.\\\" the presidents of the united states of america were so pleased with \\\"gump\\\", yankovic's parody of their song \\\"lump\\\", that they ended the song with his last line instead of their own (\\\"and that's all i have to say about that\\\") on the live recording of \\\"lump\\\" featured on the compilation album pure frosting. in 2008, yankovic directed the music video for their song \\\"mixed up s.o.b.\\\" don mclean was reportedly pleased with \\\"the saga begins\\\", a parody of \\\"american pie\\\", and told yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances. his parody not only replicates the music from the original don mclean song, but it replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus. additionally, george lucas loved the song and a lucasfilm representative told yankovic, \\\"you should have seen the smile on his face.\\\" chamillionaire was also very pleased, even putting yankovic's parody \\\"white & nerdy\\\" (a parody of \\\"ridin'\\\") on his official myspace page before it was on yankovic's own page. chamillionaire stated in an interview, \\\"he's actually rapping pretty good on it, it's crazy ... i didn't know he could rap like that. it's really an honor when he does that. ... weird al is not gonna do a parody of your song if you're not doing it big.\\\" in september 2007, chamillionaire credited \\\"white & nerdy\\\" for his recent grammy win, stating \\\"that parody was the reason i won the grammy, because it made the record so big it was undeniable. it was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of weird al's song.\\\" in 2011, yankovic was initially denied permission to parody lady gaga's \\\"born this way\\\" for his song \\\"perform this way\\\" for release on a new album, but through his release of the song on youtube and subsequent spread via twitter, lady gaga and her staff asserted that her manager had made the decision without her input, and gaga herself gave yankovic permission to proceed with the parody's release. gaga considered herself \\\"a huge weird al fan\\\", and she stated that the parody was a \\\"rite of passage\\\" for her musical career and considered the song \\\"very empowering\\\".  negative one of yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's \\\"amish paradise\\\", based on \\\"gangsta's paradise\\\" by hip-hop artist coolio, which, in turn, was based on \\\"pastime paradise\\\" by stevie wonder. reportedly, coolio's label gave yankovic the impression that coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but coolio maintains that he never did. while coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and coolio accepted royalty payments for the song. after this controversy, yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. at the xm satellite radio booth at the 2006 consumer electronics show yankovic and coolio made peace. on his website, yankovic wrote of this event, \\\"i don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. i doubt i'll be invited to coolio's next birthday party, but at least i can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.\\\" in 2003, yankovic was denied permission to make a video for \\\"couch potato\\\", his parody of eminem's \\\"lose yourself\\\": \\nlast year, eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'lose yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. \\nfor the poodle hat al tv special, yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a fake interview with eminem. as yankovic has always done for his al tv specials, he edited the footage of a previous eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect.  refused parodies on numerous occasions, prince has refused yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. yankovic has stated in interviews that he has \\\"approached him every few years to see if he's lightened up.\\\" yankovic related one story where, prior to the american music awards where he and prince were assigned to sit in the same row, he got a telegram from prince's lawyers, demanding he not make eye contact with the artist. led zeppelin guitarist jimmy page is a self-proclaimed yankovic fan, but when yankovic wished to create a polka medley of led zeppelin songs, page refused. yankovic was, however, allowed the very rare opportunity to re-record a sample of \\\"black dog\\\" for a segment of \\\"trapped in the drive-thru\\\". paul mccartney, also a yankovic fan, refused yankovic permission to record a parody of wings' \\\"live and let die\\\", titled \\\"chicken pot pie\\\", because mccartney is a vegetarian and found the parody to be improper. in 2006, yankovic gained james blunt's permission to record a parody of \\\"you're beautiful\\\". however, after yankovic had recorded \\\"you're pitiful\\\", blunt's label, atlantic records, rescinded this permission, despite blunt's personal approval of the song. the parody was pulled from yankovic's straight outta lynwood due to his label's unwillingness to \\\"go to war\\\" with atlantic. yankovic released the song as a free download on his myspace profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not blunt himself objecting to the parody. \\n\\nlive performances:\\n\\nyankovic often describes his live concert performances as \\\"a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza\\\" with an audience that \\\"ranges from toddlers to geriatrics.\\\" apart from yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes. a concert from yankovic's 1999 tour for the running with scissors album (\\\"touring with scissors\\\") was released on vhs in 1999 and on dvd in 2000. titled \\\"weird al\\\" yankovic live!, the concert was recorded at the marin county civic center in san rafael, california, on october 2, 1999. for legal reasons, video clips (apart from those for yankovic's own music videos) could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance. 2003 saw yankovic on tour overseas for the first time. before 2003, yankovic and his band had toured only the united states and parts of canada. following the success of poodle hat in australia, yankovic performed eleven shows in australia's major capital cities and regional areas in october of that year. yankovic returned to australia and toured new zealand for the first time in 2007 to support the straight outta lynwood album. on september 8, 2007, yankovic performed his 1,000th live show at idaho falls, idaho. he performed his first ever european mini-tour, including an appearance at the all tomorrow's parties music festival in minehead, england in december 2010. yankovic was picked to perform by the canadian band godspeed you! black emperor, who curated the festival's lineup. yankovic played three other dates in the uk around his festival appearance before performing a single date in the netherlands. \\n\\nother work:\\n\\nuhf:\\nin 1989, yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager jay levey, and filmed in tulsa, oklahoma called uhf. a satire of the television and film industries, also starring michael richards, fran drescher, and victoria jackson, it brought floundering studio orion their highest test scores since the movie robocop. however, it was unsuccessful in theaters. the film has since become a cult classic, with out-of-print copies of the vhs version selling for up to $100 on ebay until the release of the dvd in 2002. yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which mgm, the film's current owner, initially objected in the form of a cease and desist letter). in an apparent attempt to make it more accessible to overseas audiences, where the term uhf is used less frequently to describe tv broadcasts, the film was titled the vidiot from uhf in australia and parts of europe. uhf shows the creation of yankovic's signature food--the twinkie wiener sandwich. the snack consists of an overturned twinkie split open as a makeshift bun, a hot dog, and easy cheese put together and dipped in milk before eating. yankovic has stated that he has switched to using tofu hot dogs since becoming a vegetarian, but still enjoys the occasional twinkie wiener sandwich. \\n\\nnotable television appearances:\\nyankovic had a tv series called the weird al show, which aired from september 1997 to december 1997 on cbs. though the show appeared to be geared at children, the humor was really more for his adult fans (as such, it is often compared to pee-wee's playhouse). the entire series was released on dvd by shout! factory on august 15, 2006. yankovic has hosted al tv on mtv and al music on muchmusic many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. for poodle hat, al tv appeared on vh1 for the first time. a recurring segment of al tv involves yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. he inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity. vh1 produced a behind the music episode on yankovic. his two commercial failures (his film uhf and his 1986 album polka party!) were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. also, coolio's later disapproval of \\\"amish paradise\\\" was played up as a large feud. much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. the episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the \\\"behind the music remastered\\\" series. yankovic has done voice-overs for a number of animated series. he appeared in a 2003 episode of the simpsons, singing \\\"the ballad of homer & marge\\\" (a parody of john mellencamp's \\\"jack and diane\\\") with his band. the episode, \\\"three gays of the condo\\\", in which marge hires yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an emmy award for \\\"outstanding animated program (for programming less than one hour)\\\". yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled \\\"that '90s show\\\", during which he records a parody of homer's grunge hit \\\"shave me\\\" titled \\\"brain freeze\\\" (homer's song, \\\"shave me\\\", was itself a parody of nirvana's \\\"rape me\\\") making yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves. he appeared in the animated adult swim show robot chicken, which provided him with a music video for the song \\\"weasel stomping day\\\". yankovic is the voice for squid hat on the cartoon network show, the grim adventures of billy & mandy. he is also the announcer of the cartoon's eponymous video game adaptation. yankovic had a guest appearance voicing wreck-gar, a waste collection vehicle transformer in the transformers: animated cartoon series; previously, yankovic's \\\"dare to be stupid\\\" song was featured in the 1986 animated film the transformers: the movie, during the sequence in which the wreck-gar character was first introduced; as such, the song is referenced in the episode. he also plays local tv talent show host uncle muscles on several episodes of tim and eric awesome show, great job along with other appearances on the show. weird al has also supplied the voice of one-shot character 'petroleum joe' on the brak show. he also voiced himself on a back at the barnyard episode, and he appeared as a ringmaster who helps the regular characters of yo gabba gabba organize a circus in a 2007 episode of the children's show. in 2012, al was extensively featured in the sixth season episode of 30 rock called \\\"kidnapped by danger\\\", where jenna tries to come up with a \\\"weird al-proof\\\" song, as well as appearing on two episodes of the aquabats! super show!, playing two different characters as the superhero supermagic powerman and as the president of the united states. an exhaustive list of television shows on which yankovic has appeared is available on his official website. \\n\\ndirecting career:\\n\\\"weird al\\\" yankovic has directed many of his own music videos; he has directed all of his music videos from 1993's \\\"bedrock anthem\\\" to 2006's \\\"white & nerdy\\\". he also directed the end sequence of 1986's \\\"christmas at ground zero\\\" (an original piece juxtaposing christmas with nuclear warfare) from his polka party! album and the title sequence to spy hard, for which he sang the title song. yankovic wrote, directed and starred in the short 3-d movie attraction \\\"al's brain: a 3-d journey through the human brain\\\", which premiered at the orange county fair in costa mesa, california in 2009. the us$2.5 million project sponsored by the orange county fair, including a brief cameo by sir paul mccartney that yankovic directed during mccartney's tour at the 2009 coachella valley music and arts festival. fair ceo steve beazley, who supported the project, considers the project a success and is considering leasing the exhibit to other fairs; the second appearance of the exhibit will be at the puyallup fair in washington. in addition to his own, he has directed several videos for hanson (the titanic sequences in \\\"river\\\"), the black crowes (\\\"only a fool\\\"), ben folds (\\\"rockin' the suburbs\\\"), jeff foxworthy (\\\"redneck stomp\\\" and \\\"party all night\\\"), blues explosion (\\\"wail\\\"), and the presidents of the united states of america (\\\"mixed up s.o.b\\\"). he has cameo appearances in his videos for blues explosion, hanson (as the interviewer), and ben folds (as the producer fixing folds' \\\"shitty tracks\\\").  cartoon network feature film on january 25, 2010, yankovic announced that he signed a production deal with warner bros. and is set to write and direct a live-action feature film. although yankovic previously wrote the script for uhf, this was to be the first movie yankovic directed. little is currently known about the movie. however, yankovic did state that he would not be starring in the movie, as cartoon network wanted a younger protagonist. during an interview on the comedy death-ray radio, yankovic revealed that though cartoon network \\\"loved\\\" his script, the network decided that they were no longer intending to produce feature films. yankovic stated that he would instead shop the script around to other potential studios. \\n\\nwriting:\\nyankovic wrote when i grow up (isbn 978-0-06-192691-4), a children's book released on february 1, 2011 and published by harpercollins. the book features 8-year-old billy presenting to his class the wide variety of imaginative career possibilities that he is considering. yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own \\\"circuitous\\\" career path. the book allows yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes. yankovic worked with harper collins' editor anne hoppe--the first time that yankovic has had an editor--and found her help as a positive experience. the book is illustrated by wes hargis, who, according to yankovic, has a \\\"a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality\\\" that matched well with yankovic's writing. the book reached the no. 4 position on the new york times best seller list for children's picture books for the week of february 20, 2011. \\n\\nweb media:\\nin 2008, weird al joined michael j. nelson as a guest on the rifftrax treatment of jurassic park. on november 10, 2009, weird al was a guest \\\"internet scientist\\\" on rocketboom's \\\"know your meme\\\" video series, in the installment on the topic of autotune, hosted by jamie wilkinson.  eric appel produced a funny or die movie trailer for \\\"weird: the al yankovic story\\\", a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians; yankovic (played by aaron paul) is seen hiding his \\\"weirdness\\\" from his parents (gary cole and mary steenburgen), making it big using song parodies with the help of dr. demento (patton oswalt), falling in and out of love with madonna (olivia wilde), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, where his father finally admits he is \\\"weird\\\" as well. yankovic himself plays a music producer in the short. for nerdist, weird al began hosting a new comedic celebrity interview web series, face to face with 'weird al' yankovic on april 3, 2012. \\n\\nother media:\\nyankovic competed on a week of wheel of fortune taped at disney's hollywood studios in march 1994. he also competed on rock & roll jeopardy! weird al joined the band hanson in their music video for \\\"thinking bout somethin\\\" in which he plays the tambourine. yankovic contributes backing vocals for the song \\\"time\\\" on ben folds' album songs for silverman. yankovic also appeared in the recent halloween ii as himself on a news channel. yankovic was also one of many celebrities who took part in the noh8 campaign against proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage in california. yankovic was approached by a beer company to endorse their product. yankovic had turned it down because he believed that \\\"a lot of my fans were young and impressionable.\\\" yankovic later posted on his twitter account that he never regretted the decision. in 2011, yankovic guest starred as the character \\\"banana man\\\" in an episode of adventure time. the same year, he appeared as himself in the how i met your mother episode \\\"noretta\\\". \\n\\nmisattribution and imitators:\\n\\nsongs posted to file sharing networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter. often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as \\\"yankovich\\\", among other variations. much to the disdain of yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. a young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted yankovic online, threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics. quite a few of the songs, such as \\\"star wars cantina\\\" by the pre-lounge against the machine mark jonathan davis, \\\"star wars gangsta rap\\\", \\\"yoda smokes weed\\\", \\\"chewbacca\\\" and several more have a star wars motif. some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as \\\"sesame street on crack\\\", which is also widely misattributed to adam sandler. yankovic cites these misattributions as \\\"his only real beef with peer-to-peer file sharing sites\\\": \\nif you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, i guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs i had absolutely nothing to do with. that particularly bothers me, because i really try to do quality work, and i also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image--and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. i truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake weird al songs floating around the internet. \\na list of songs frequently misattributed to yankovic can be found at the not al page and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by yankovic can be found on his website. in an episode of hbo's \\\"mr. show with bob and david\\\" called rudy will await your foundation, bob odenkirk plays a character called daffy \\\"mal\\\" yinkleyankle, a parody of weird al. al, who claims it was the only genuine parody act on himself he has ever seen, told odenkirk over e-mail that he was \\\"flattered, in a weird way\\\" and \\\"found it very funny\\\". \\n\\nfan-driven campaigns:\\nthe weird al star fund is a campaign started by yankovic's fans to get him a star on the hollywood walk of fame. their mission is to \\\"solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate \\\"weird al\\\" yankovic for a star on the hollywood walk of fame.\\\" fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the us$15,000 needed for a nomination. in addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held april 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and ebay, including t-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks. on may 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the may 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork. however, yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007. on february 9, 2007, the hollywood chamber of commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000 and as such the fund is accepting donations again. yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees. similar to the weird al star fund, a second fan-driven campaign called \\\"make the rock hall 'weird'\\\" has tried to enshrine him into rock and roll hall of fame in cleveland, ohio, for which he has been eligible since 2004. previous attempts to raise awareness for the campaign and support yankovic's nomination included a petition drive from 2006 to 2007, which raised over 9000 signatures; an art competition in 2005; additionally, a documentary film about the campaign is currently being developed. in addition to these efforts, an ongoing campaign is underway in which supporters of yankovic's nomination are requested to send

vocals, \\nkeith relf - vocals, guitar, harmonica, \\njohn hawken - keyboards, \\nlouis cennamo - bass, \\njim mccarty - drums, vocals, \\nin january 1969, former yardbirds members keith relf and jim mccarty organised a new group devoted to experimentation between rock, folk, and classical forms. this quintet--relf on guitar and vocals, mccarty on drums, plus bassist louis cennamo, pianist john hawken, and relf's sister jane as an additional vocalist--released a pair of albums on elektra (us) and island (uk-ilps 9112), the first one, titled simply renaissance, being produced by fellow ex-yardbird paul samwell-smith. \\nthe band had begun performing in may 1969, before recording had begun for the debut lp, mostly in the uk, but with occasional forays abroad, including festivals in belgium (amougies, october 1969) and france (operation 666 at the olympia in january 1970, and le bourget in march 1970, both in paris). in february 1970, they embarked on a north american tour, but that month-long trek proved marginally successful, as, because of their yardbirds credentials, they found themselves paired with bands such as the kinks, and their new classically oriented direction did not always go down well with audiences. \\nbeginning in the late spring of 1970, as touring began to grind on them, the original band gradually dissolved. relf and mccarty decided to quit performing, and cennamo joined colosseum. hawken organised a new line-up to fulfil contractual obligations and complete the band's second album, illusion, which was left unfinished. \\n transition (1970-71)\\napart from jane relf, the new band consisted mostly of former members of hawken's previous band, the nashville teens - guitarist michael dunford, bassist neil korner and singer terry crowe, plus drummer terry slade. this line-up recorded one track, \\\"mr pine\\\", a dunford composition, and played a few gigs during the summer of 1970. meanwhile a final recording session brought together the original line-up minus hawken, with don shin sitting in on keyboards, and produced the album's closing track \\\"past orbits of dust\\\". the now completed illusion was released in germany in 1971, although not released in the uk until 1976 (island help 27). the album marked the beginning of renaissance's long-standing collaboration with poet betty thatcher-newsinger as lyricist when she co-wrote two songs with relf and mccarty. \\nthe last two remaining original members left in the autumn of 1970. jane relf was replaced by american folk singer anne-marie \\\"binky\\\" cullum, then john hawken left to join spooky tooth and pianist john tout replaced him. there is an extant video (released on the dvd \\\"kings & queens\\\" in 2010) of that line-up performing five songs on a german tv program (muzik-kanal). the plan at the time was that keith relf and jim mccarty would remain involved as non-performing members - relf as a producer and mccarty as a songwriter. both were present when singer annie haslam successfully auditioned in january 1971 to replace the departing cullum (who would later marry drummer terry slade and is currently a massage therapist in the uk). but while mccarty would go on to write songs for the new band, relf's involvement would be short-lived. dunford soon emerged as a prolific composer, and also continued the writing partnership with thatcher, who would go on to write most of the lyrics for the band's 1970s albums. \\n second incarnation (1971-80)\\nannie haslam (vocals), \\nmichael dunford (guitar), \\njohn tout (keyboards), \\njon camp (bass, vocals), \\nterence sullivan (drums, percussion), \\nsometime in 1971, new manager miles copeland iii decided to re-organise the band, focussing on what he felt were renaissance's strong points - annie haslam's voice and john tout's piano. until then haslam had shared vocals with terry crowe, who was in effect the band's chief vocalist. crowe and korner went, the former unreplaced, the latter replaced by a succession of bass players, including john wetton (later of king crimson and asia), frank farrell (later in supertramp) and danny mcculloch (formerly of the animals and a former bandmate of dunford and crowe in the plebs), until the position settled with the inclusion of jon camp. it was also decided that dunford would now concentrate on composing, and a new guitar player, mick parsons, was brought in for live work. in 1972, shortly before recording sessions for the new band's debut lp, drummer terence sullivan joined, after slade's initial replacement, ginger dixon, was deemed unsuitable following a european tour. tragically guitarist parsons died in a car accident and was replaced at short notice by rob hendry. the resulting line-up entered the studio having played only a dozen gigs together. \\nprologue was released later in 1972 on emi-sovereign records (uk), with music composed by dunford (except for two songs by mccarty), with all lyrics by thatcher. rock radio stations (particularly in the us northeast and cleveland) gave the song spare some love significant airplay for a few months after the album's release, and fans of yes and emerson, lake & palmer in particular, took notice of the band. francis monkman, of the group curved air (another group managed by miles copeland), guested on synthesiser on the final track \\\"rajah khan\\\". \\nhendry was replaced for the prologue tour by peter finberg, who in turn left the group shortly before the sessions for the next album. michael dunford then returned as (acoustic) guitarist, completing what most fans regard as the classic five-piece line-up, which would remain together through six studio albums. ashes are burning was released in 1973. andy powell, of the group wishbone ash, was brought in for a blistering electric guitar solo on the final track \\\"ashes are burning\\\", which became the band's anthem piece, extended to almost twenty minutes with a long bass solo and other instrumental workouts. (john tout returned powell's favour by playing organ on wishbone's classic album \\\"argus\\\".) the album became the band's first to chart in the us, where it reached #171 on the billboard 200. the band played their first us concerts during that period, enjoying success on the east coast in particular, which soon resulted in a special orchestral concert at new york's academy of music in may 1974. soon renaissance would choose to concentrate on the us market, as the uk press virtually ignored them, seeing the original band as the only legitimate renaissance. \\nthe band left sovereign records, and joined miles copeland's new prog rock stable and label btm (for british talent management). the label's first release was turn of the cards in 1974. with a larger budget, the album went from folk-flavoured to a more dark, lush, orchestral rock sound. one of the album's songs, \\\"things i don't understand\\\", which clocked in at 9:30, was jim mccarty's last co-writing credit with the group (although it was actually in the band's live repertoire for years). a lengthy tribute to aleksandr solzhenitsyn, called \\\"mother russia\\\", closed out the album, with lyrics inspired by his autobiographical novel, \\\"one day in the life of ivan denisovich\\\". the lp was first issued in the united states on sire records in august 1974, where it reached #94, some months before an official uk release. although the band's fan base was relatively small, its following was heavily concentrated in the large cities of the northeast us. the album was eventually released in the uk in march 1975. \\nit was soon followed by scheherazade and other stories, released on both sides of the atlantic in september 1975. the album, whose second side was taken up with the epic tone-poem \\\"song of scheherazade\\\" based on stories from one thousand and one nights, peaked at #48 in the united states. \\na double live album, live at carnegie hall, followed in 1976. despite criticisms that much of the album was little more than a note for note reproduction of highlights from their previous four studio albums  the album reached #55 in the us. revealingly, in introducing the song \\\"ashes are burning\\\" haslam refers to it as the title track from the group's second album, rather than their fourth, suggesting that the haslam-led lineup by this point considered themselves a distinct band from keith relf's incarnation of the group. \\nits follow-up, novella, also saw a modest chart success in the us, peaking at #46 in 1977, although its uk release was delayed by yet another label change. \\nin the 1970s, renaissance defined their work with folk rock and classical fusions. their songs include quotations from and allusions to such composers as alain, bach, chopin, debussy, giazotto, jarre, rachmaninoff, rimsky-korsakov, prokofiev and shostakovich. renaissance records, especially ashes are burning, were frequently played on american progressive rock radio stations such as wnew-fm, whfs-fm, wmmr-fm, kshe 95 and wvbr. \\n\\nalthough commercial success was limited during this period, renaissance scored a hit single in britain with \\\"northern lights\\\", which reached #10 there during the summer of 1978. the single was taken from the album a song for all seasons (a #58 album in the us), and received significant airplay on not only aor stations, but also on radio stations adapting to a new format known as \\\"soft rock\\\", now known as adult contemporary rock through the spring and summer of 1978. the band performed on a modestly successful tour of the us east of the mississippi and drew significant crowds in state college, pennsylvania, and cleveland, ohio during the late spring and early summer of 1979 promoting both a song for all seasons and a mix of old and new tracks. \\nrenaissance floundered following 1979's azure d'or, as many fans couldn't relate to a largely synthesizer-oriented sound. as a result the band's fan base began to lose interest and the album only reached #125. michael dunford and jon camp assumed most of the band's songwriting. \\n later days\\nafter the azure d'or tour, john tout left the group for personal reasons, quickly followed by terry sullivan. subsequent albums camera camera (1981) and time-line (1983) brought renaissance more into the contemporary synth pop genre, but neither garnered enough commercial interest to make a viable future for the band (camera camera was the band's final album to chart in the us where it reached #196 in late 1981). in 1985 camp left, and haslam and dunford led an acoustic version of the band and performed occasional shows (the last being in georgetown, dc until splitting up in august 1987. \\nin 1988, sire issued a two-part compilation, tales of 1001 nights, focusing on the band's 1972-79 period. in the 1990s most of their catalogue appeared on cd from reissue record labels such as repertoire records (germany). in 2006 repertoire issued remastered versions of ashes are burning, turn of the cards and scheherezade; however, they have been criticised for having a heavily compressed sound. \\nin the mid 1990s both haslam (who had released a self-titled solo album in 1989) and dunford (who had been working on a proposed musical based on the scheherazade storyline) formed their own bands using the name renaissance and released albums with different line-ups. \\nrenaissance partially reformed in 1998 around a nucleus of haslam, dunford and sullivan, plus tout and several new musicians, most notably roy wood and mickey simmonds, to record the cd tuscany. in 1999, haslam, dunford and simmonds played a one-off trio concert at london's astoria supporting caravan. in 2001, following the delayed release of tuscany, a full band tour was organised, consisting of one london concert (again at the astoria) and several dates in japan. it was documented on the live release in the land of the rising sun: live in japan 2001. (tout, although in the audience at the astoria, did not perform on this tour). annie haslam, who had become the band's spokesperson, said that several factors made further touring and recording impractical. the band's short third incarnation was soon over. \\nterry sullivan has since recorded an album called south of winter with a studio group he named renaissant. it is evocative of renaissance's music, with lyrics by betty thatcher and keyboard contributions by john tout. \\non 20 september 2008, john tout made his first public appearance in the us in over 25 years, with annie haslam and the jann klose band, at the sellersville theatre 1984 in sellersville, pennsylvania. \\nsometime before the summer of 2009, john tout suffered a heart attack. \\nin august 2009, annie haslam announced that she and michael dunford were commemorating the 40th anniversary of renaissance with a reformed band, called renaissance 2009 (including no other members of the \\\"classic\\\" line-up, but with musicians from the 2001 incarnation of the band), and a concert tour. \\na tour in eastern north america and japan was undertaken in 2010, together with a three song ep release and a new official website. further concerts took place during the fall of 2011 featuring haslam, but no other former band-mates. \\nthe band will headline the sold out final edition of the north east art

nickelodeon. the series premiered on august 11, 1991, and aired its last episode on june 8, 2004. the show focuses on a group of toddlers and their day-to-day lives, usually involving common life experiences that become adventures in the babies' imaginations. it was one of the first three nicktoons and also aired on nick jr. in 1995. \\n\\ncharacters:\\nthe series focuses on the experiences of a courageous, adventurous one-year-old baby named tommy pickles and his group of playmates -- several other infants and toddlers, some of whom debuted later in the series: chuckie, tommy's bespectacled, redheaded, insecure cowardly best friend, the twins phil and lil, noted for their revolting eccentricities and love of digging for and eating insects (particularly earthworms), tommy's baby brother dil (who was born in the rugrats movie), angelica, tommy and dil's outrageously spoiled, selfish older cousin and the main antagonist of the program, kimi, chuckie's adventurous, playful stepsister (introduced a bit later on in the animated series alongside chuckie's stepmother kira in rugrats in paris), and suzy, angelica's schoolmate and kindhearted, understanding rival who is better liked by the infants and far more reliable than angelica. the other characters depicted in rugrats, naturally, include the babies' parents, who are portrayed as often being easily-distracted, leaving their young children free to emancipate themselves from restraints such as playpens or strollers and venture out for the exploration of that particular episode. such adult figures include didi and stu pickles, tommy and dil's mother and father, didi being a sweet, educated, loving mother and possibly a bit of a renaissance woman (telling by her interests and knowledge in certain cultures or festivals when she and the other parents bring the babies to different locations or attractions) who decides to return to college in one episode and stu being an often-feckless toy inventor whose designs have been known to either fail or break. other parents include chas finster, chuckie's stereotypically-nerdy, mild-mannered father; a widower who later remarries with kira, chuckie's sweet-natured, kind, and understanding stepmother in rugrats in paris, drew pickles, angelica's indulgent, doting father who pampers his daughter to a ridiculous degree, charlotte pickles, angelica's working mother who overindulges her daughter equally and possesses the character hallmark of arguing on her cellular phone with an employee of hers, jonathan; betty deville, phil and lil's kind but masculinely-natured mother and howard deville, the twins' mild-mannered, soft-spoken father. suzy's parents and elder siblings also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes lou pickles, drew and stu's father and tommy, angelica, and dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named lulu. didi's parents, jewish foreigners named boris and minka, also appear numerous times and serve as important characters and are often seen bickering. characters of somewhat lesser importance include the pickles family dog, spike, who has played important roles in some episodes, even starring in them at some instances, and angelica's pet cat fluffy. \\n\\norigins:\\nrugrats was formed by the then husband-and-wife duo of gabor csupo and arlene klasky, along with paul germain in 1989. klasky-csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos. klasky, csupo, and germain were also animating the simpsons at the time, which they would continue to do until 1992. the trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children's cable network nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated shows, which would be later called nicktoons. with the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of klasky and csupo's infant children, the 6\\u20442-minute pilot episode, \\\"tommy pickles & the great white thing\\\" (never to be aired), went into production. peter chung, along with klasky and csupo, co-designed the characters and directed the series pilot, \\\"tommy pickles and the great white thing,\\\" as well as the opening sequence. the production was completed in 1990 and they submitted it to nickelodeon, who tested it with an audience of children. the feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive. with that, the series went into production. chuckie and angelica were added as characters. paul germain felt that the series needed a bully. angelica was based on a bully in germain's childhood, who was a girl. in addition to that, it was germain who decided that angelica would be a spoiled brat. arlene klasky, one of the show's creators initially did not like angelica pickles. klasky also protested angelica's actions in episodes like \\\"barbecue story\\\" (where she threw tommy's ball over the fence). in a new yorker article, klasky said, \\\"i think she's a bully. i never liked angelica.\\\" klasky never fully approved of her character development. her bullying caused arlene to disdain her. angelica started to become a problem for the some of the rugrats staff. in some instances, her voice, cheryl chase, had trouble portraying a mean angelica. to help chase out, steve viksen, one of the writers, would mention that angelica was the series's j.r. ewing. after the episode \\\"the trial,\\\" klasky complained that the rugrats were starting to act too old for their age. csupo often acted as a mediator in arguments between klasky and the writers, with the writers often winning. some of the offscreen tensions ultimately found their way into the scripts and, naturally, into the show. in 1993, shortly before nick premiered the last of the original 65, production of new episodes ceased, and most of the rugrats writing team left klasky-csupo. after the first run days were over, nick had enough episodes to show every day, and did just that in 1994, scheduling the show in the early evening, when both kids and parents will be watching. after 3 years of repeats, the show went back into production. however, the tensions between klasky-csupo and their former writers still existed. after the rugrats movie and seeing the \\\"new\\\" angelica in the film, klasky changed her tune: \\\"i think she's great for the show; i love angelica.\\\" \\n\\nproduction:\\nrugrats was nickelodeon's second nicktoon, debuting on the same day as doug (which premiered before it) and the ren and stimpy show (which debuted after). the first run of the series was produced from 1991 to 1993 before production went on a hiatus (episodes that had not yet been released at that point continued to be released through 1994). between 1995 and 1996, only two jewish-themed specials were aired, and the rest of the series aired in reruns. production on new episodes restarted in 1997, and the show aired in nickelodeon's snick block from 1997 to 2000. from 1994 until 2012, rugrats was nickelodeon's longest-running nicktoon, with 172 episodes produced across its thirteen year run. it was surpassed in 2012 by spongebob squarepants when that series aired its 173rd episode in 2012.  on august 11, 2001, rugrats celebrated its 10-year anniversary. the special/tv movie, rugrats: all growed up was produced for the occasion. after the show, a special retrospective lookback aired, entitled \\\"rugrats: still babies after all these years.\\\" it was narrated by amanda bynes. nickelodeon approved of its ratings and popularity so much (about 70% of viewers with cable tuned in), they eventually commissioned a full series, all grown up, which ran from 2003 to 2008. rugrats ended in 2004, along with fellow nicktoon, hey arnold. after the run, two fairy-tale themed direct-to-video films based on the original series under the title, rugrats: tales from the crib were produced and then released separately in 2005 and in 2006. \\n\\nvoice actors:\\nthrough its full run, rugrats, occupied several main voice actors. e.g. daily provided the voice of tommy pickles, except in the unaired pilot where tami holbrook provided the voice; christine cavanaugh was the original voice of chuckie finster, but left after 2001 for personal reasons and was subsequently replaced by nancy cartwright in 2002. the fraternal twins, phil and lil (as well as their mother, betty) were voiced by kath soucie; dil pickles (and timmy mcnulty) were voiced by tara strong. cheryl chase initially auditioned for the role of tommy, but was passed up. when the show came to series, she was brought on board to be cast as the voice of angelica pickles. dionne quan was the voice of kimi finster, however as she is legally blind, in order to do the voice, the producers had to interpret the scripts into braille, so she could read them by sensing the bumps with her fingers. susie was primarily voiced by cree summer, though in two episodes where she could not be in attendance e.g. daily filled in. other regular voice actors included melanie chartoff as didi pickles, jack riley as stu pickles, tress macneille as charlotte pickles, and michael bell as drew pickles and chaz finster. david doyle provided the voice of grandpa lou pickles until his death in 1997, where joe alaskey took over till the end of the series. in 2000, debbie reynolds joined the cast as lulu pickles, lou's second wife, and remained until the series' end. \\n\\nepisode production:\\nwith rugrats it usually took a few months to make an episode, for the story has to get written, and then approved. the next process consisted of voice recording, storyboarding, pre-eliminating animation, overseas production & delivery, editing and polishing. all of that had to happen even before klasky-csupo sent the master tapes to nick. in addition, fine animation took time to make. during the first six seasons of rugrats, shows were primarily divided into two eleven-minute episodes. after the second movie, during season seven, rugrats made a change with a different format that consisted of three episodes per show, though it returned to its original two-episode-per-show format in the final two seasons. \\n\\nepisodes:\\n\\nother projects:\\n\\ndvd releases:\\nnickelodeon and amazon.com have struck a deal to produce dvds of new and old nickelodeon shows, through the createspace service. using a concept similar to print on demand, amazon made the discs, cover art, and disc art itself. the first and second seasons of rugrats were released on june 2, 2009, along with the fairly oddparents first and second seasons (although the second rugrats set contained only the first half of the season 2 episodes). season 3 and 4 were released on september 23, 2011, through the createspace program. season 5 was released shortly after on october 4. on october 6, 2011, the complete seasons 6-8 were released through

reception:\\nsince its debut in 1991, rugrats generally received positive reviews from critics and fans. in a 1995 interview, steven spielberg (who, at the time, was producing several competing animated series for warner bros.) referred to the show as one of several shows that are the best children's programming at the time. spielberg described rugrats as \\\"sort of a tv peanuts of our time.\\\" it was named the 92nd-best animated series by ign.rugrats was also considered a strong point in nickelodeon's rise in the 1990s. in a press release celebrating the show's 10th anniversary, cyma zarghami stated, \\\"during the past decade, 'rugrats' has evolved from a ratings powerhouse, being the number one children's show on tv, to pop icon status. it has secured a place in the hearts of both kids and adults, who see it from their own point of view\\\". according to nickelodeon producers, this show made them the number-one channel in the 1990s.jeff jarvis reviewed rugrats and stated, \\\"when the simpsons was a segment on the tracey ullman show, it was just a belch joke with hip pretensions. as a series, it grew flesh and guts. it was my favorite cartoon...until i discovered nickelodeon's rugrats, a sardonic, sly, kid's eye view of the world that skewers thirty-something parents and (the) cosby (show) kids.\\\" \\n\\npopularity, appeal, and controversy:\\nsee also: judaism in rugratswhen rugrats d\\u00e9buted in 1991, it was not as hugely popular as it would later become. when production went on a hiatus from 1994, nick began showing rugrats repeats everyday. more and more people began to take notice of the show, with ratings and popularity for rugrats and nick rising. from 1995 to 2000, it was the highest-rated show on nickelodeon and the highest rated kids' show. the show experienced a wide diverse audience consisting of kids, teenagers and adults alike. rugrats was successful in receiving an average of 26.7 million viewers every week: 14.7 million kids (2-11), 3.2 million teens (12-17), and 8.8 million adults (18 and over). in addition, rugrats was seen internationally in over 76 countries. it was the only one of the three original nicktoons that continued in the 2000s (decade), and had its own spin-off. it is the most successful of the three original nicktoons. while the other nicktoons were popular during their run, doug would later slip out of nick's hands and into disney's; and ren and stimpy would crash and burn in a creative rights dispute (only to return several years later in a much raunchier version on another network). during its run, rugrats was enjoyed by a number of famous stars including alexa vega, daryl sabara, amanda bynes, aaron carter, ray romano, nivea and bow wow. rugrats was one of very few shows that pictured observant, identifiably jewish families. jewish and christian religion groups gave the show high praises for their special holiday episodes. nonetheless, at one point the anti-defamation league and the washington post editorial page castigated the series for its depiction of tommy pickles' maternal grandparents, who purportedly looked like nazi-era depictions of jews.

star on the fabled hollywood walk of fame, making it nickelodeon's first (and to date, only) series to receive a star. it was placed at 6600 w. hollywood bl., near cherokee ave. outside a toy and costume shop. in the october 2001 issue of wizard magazine, a leading magazine for comic book fans, they released the results of the 100 greatest toons ever, as selected by their readers, rugrats ranked at #35. three other nicktoons--spongebob squarepants, invader zim, and ren and stimpy--also placed on the list. in a list of tv land's the 2000 best things about television, ranking the all-time tv shows, channels, commercials, people, catch phrases, etc., rugrats is ranked #699. angelica pickles placed 7th in tv guide's list of \\\"top 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time\\\" in 2002. \\n\\nrugrats in other media:\\n\\nfilms:\\nin 1998, the rugrats movie was released, which introduced baby dil, tommy's little brother, onto the show. it grossed in worldwide results, $140,894,675, making it a very large box office success, considering its modest $24 million budget, though it also received mixed reviews from critics. in 2000 a sequel, rugrats in paris: the movie, was released, with two new characters introduced, kimi and kira. kimi would become chuckie's sister and kira would become his new mother, after marrying his father. it too was a box office success and also received a more positive critical reception. in 2003, rugrats go wild was released. it was a crossover between the rugrats and the wild thornberrys. it was the least successful rugrats film both critically and commercially. \\n\\ncomics:\\nfrom 1998 to 2003, nick produced a rugrats comic strip, which was distributed through creator's syndicate. initially written by show-writer scott gray and drawn by comic book artist steve crespo, with rob armstrong as editor. will blyberg came on board shortly after as inker. by the end of '98, lee nordling, who had joined as a contributing gag writer, took over as editor. nordling hired extra writers, including gordon kent, scott roberts, chuck kim, j. torres, marc bilgrey, and john zakour, as well new artists including gary fields, tim harkins, vince giaranno, and scott roberts. stu chaifetz colored the sunday strips. the rugrats strip started out in many papers, but as often happens with spin-off strips, soon slowed down. it's still seen in

invents a magic wand called the \\\"people-ator\\\" to make chuckie brave. angelica, however, wants chuckie to stay scared, so she steals tommy's wand. the rugrats try to get it back, but to no avail. angelica becomes princess of the world. eventually, chuckie becomes brave thanks to the help of susie, mr. flashlight and the audience. many songs were included in the play, including the theme song. despite some criticism, the show was well received. the show had two 40-minute acts, with a 20-minute intermission (or a commercial break). \\n\\nmerchandise:\\nmerchandise that was based on rugrats varied from video games, toothpaste, kelloggs' cereal to slippers, puzzles, pajamas, jewelry, wrapping paper, fruit snacks, inflatable balls, watches, pens, pencils, markers, cookie jars, key rings, action figures, and bubblegum. the show also managed to spawn a popular merchandise line at wal-mart, k-mart, target, ebay, hot topic, jcpenney, toys \\\"r\\\" us, mattel, barnes & noble and basic fun, just to name a few. the rugrats had their own cereal made by post called reptar crunch cereal. the rugrats and reptar were predominantly featured on the front, there's a board game on the back, and a special $3 rebate for runaway reptar on the side. this cereal was released for a limited time only, sold at us supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the cereal. to memorialize the movie, rugrats in paris, another rugrats-based cereal came out in october 2000. simply called the rugrats in paris cereal, it has a similar appearance to trix; it's a sweetened, multi-grain cereal with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. small eiffel towers could also be seen.rugrats made fast-food appearances as well with the most appearances being on burger king. their first fast food appearance was in 1994, when the hardee's fast food chain offered a collection of nicktoons toys as premiums that were included with kids' meals at hardee's. all 4 nicktoons at that time were featured--ren & stimpy, rocko's modern life, doug and rugrats. other food items that feature rugrats were fruit snacks, macaroni and cheese, bubble gum and campbell's rugrats pasta with chicken and broth. in their first tie-in with burger king, 5 rugrats toys were offered with their kids club meals, a different one with each meal. each toy came with a 12-page (including covers) miniature version of nickelodeon magazine, which featured the toy's instructions, word search, picture puzzle, \\\"say what?\\\",a scrambled word puzzle, a coupon for oral-b rugrats toothpaste & toothbrush, and entry blanks to subscribe to rugrats comic adventures, nick magazine and the kids club. from 1998 till 2003, \\\"rugrats\\\" based-products included watches and various toys.\"]}, {\"permalink\": \"sichmang\", \"name\": \"#SICHMANG\", \"updated_at\": \"2012-07-07T02:40:43\", \"profiles\": {\"twitter\": null, \"myspace\": null, \"facebook\": null, \"soundcloud\":

\"http://api.shuffler.fm/v1/channels/artist:Queen?api-key=<api-key>\", \"id\": 1920, \"biography\": [\"queen are a british rock band formed in london in 1971, originally consisting of the late freddie mercury (lead vocals, piano), brian may (guitar, vocals), john deacon (bass guitar, guitars), and roger taylor (drums, vocals). queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music. before joining queen, brian may and roger taylor had been playing together in a band named smile with bassist tim staffell. freddie mercury (then known as farrokh/freddie bulsara) was a fan of smile, and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques after staffell's departure in 1970. mercury himself joined the band shortly thereafter, changed the name of the band to \\\"queen\\\", and adopted his familiar stage name. john deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album (1973). queen enjoyed success in the uk with their debut and its follow-up, queen ii (1974), but it was the release of sheer heart attack (1974) and a night at the opera (1975) that gained the band international success. the latter featured \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\", which stayed at number one in the uk singles chart for nine weeks; it charted at number one in several other territories, and gave the band their first top ten hit on the us billboard hot 100. their 1977 album, news of the world, contained two of rock's most recognisable anthems, \\\"we will rock you\\\" and \\\"we are the champions\\\". by the early 1980s, queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world, and their performance at 1985's live aid is regarded as one of the greatest in rock history. in 1991, mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of aids, and deacon retired in 1997. since then, may and taylor have infrequently performed together, including a collaboration with paul rodgers under the name queen + paul rodgers which ended in may 2009. the band have released a total of 18 number one albums, 18 number one singles, and 10 number one dvds. estimates of their album sales generally range from 150 million to 300 million albums, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. they received a lifetime achievement award from the british phonographic industry in 1990, and were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001. \\n\\nhistory:\\n\\nearly days (1968-1974):\\nin 1968, guitarist brian may, a student at london's imperial college, and bassist tim staffell decided to form a band. may placed an advertisement on the college notice board for a \\\"mitch mitchell/ginger baker type\\\" drummer; roger taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job. the group called themselves smile. while attending ealing art college, tim staffell became friends with farrokh bulsara, a fellow student who had assumed the english name of freddie. bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of smile. in late 1970, after staffell left to join the band humpy bong, the remaining smile members, encouraged by bulsara, changed their name to \\\"queen\\\" and continued working together. when asked about the name, bulsara explained, \\\"i thought up the name queen. it's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. it's a strong name, very universal and immediate. it had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. i was certainly aware of gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.\\\" the band had a number of bass players during this period who did not fit with the band's chemistry. it was not until february 1971 that they settled on john deacon and began to rehearse for their first album. they recorded four of their own songs, \\\"liar\\\", \\\"keep yourself alive\\\", \\\"the night comes down\\\" and \\\"jesus\\\", for a demo tape; no record companies were interested. it was also around this time freddie changed his surname to \\\"mercury\\\", inspired by the line \\\"mother mercury, look what they've done to me,\\\" in the song my fairy king. on 2 july 1971, queen played their first show in the classic line-up of mercury, may, deacon and taylor at a surrey college outside london. having attended art college, mercury also designed queen's logo, called the queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. the logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for leo (deacon and taylor), a crab for cancer (may), and two fairies for virgo (mercury). the lions embrace a stylised letter q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. there is also a crown inside the q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. the whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the united kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. the original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the first album cover, was a simple line drawing but more intricate colour versions were used on later sleeves. \\n\\nin 1973, after a series of delays, queen released their eponymous debut album, an effort influenced by the heavy metal and progressive rock of the day. the album was received well by critics; gordon fletcher of rolling stone said \\\"their debut album is superb\\\", and chicago's daily herald called it an \\\"above average debut\\\". it drew little mainstream attention, and the lead single \\\"keep yourself alive\\\", a brian may composition, sold poorly. retrospectively, \\\"keep yourself alive\\\" is cited as the highlight of the album, and in 2008 rolling stone ranked it 31st in the \\\"100 greatest guitar songs of all time\\\", describing it as \\\"an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song\\\". the album was certified gold in the uk and the us. the group's second lp, queen ii, was released in 1974, and features rock photographer mick rock's iconic image of the band on the cover. this image would be used as the basis for the 1975 \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" music video production. the album reached number five on the british album chart and became the first queen album to chart in the uk. the freddie mercury-written lead single \\\"seven seas of rhye\\\" reached number ten in the uk, giving the band their first hit. the album is the first real testament to the band's distinctive layered sound, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and musical virtuosity. aside from its only single, the album also included the song \\\"the march of the black queen\\\", a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus or song structure, bearing similarity to queen's later work, \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\". the daily vault described the number as \\\"menacing\\\". critical reaction was mixed; the winnipeg free press describing the record as a \\\"monstrosity\\\". allmusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans, and it is the first of three queen albums to feature in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you die. \\n\\nsheer heart attack to a night at the opera (1974-1976):\\nafter the band's six-night stand at new york's uris theatre in may 1974, brian may collapsed and was diagnosed as having hepatitis. while recuperating, may was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. released in 1974, sheer heart attack reached number two in the united kingdom, sold well throughout europe, and went gold in the united states. it gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the atlantic. the album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including british music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and caribbean. at this point, queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-oriented style.sheer heart attack introduced new sound and melody patterns that would be refined on their next album, a night at the opera. the single \\\"killer queen\\\" reached number two on the british charts, and became their first us hit, reaching number 12 on the billboard hot 100. it combines camp, vaudeville, and british music hall with may's guitar virtuosity. the album's second single, \\\"now i'm here\\\", a more traditional hard rock composition, was a number eleven hit in britain, while the high speed rocker \\\"stone cold crazy\\\" featuring may's uptempo riffs is a precursor to speed metal. in recent years, the album has received acclaim from music publications: in 2006, classic rock ranked it number 28 in \\\"the 100 greatest british rock albums ever\\\", and in 2007, mojo ranked it no.88 in \\\"the 100 records that changed the world\\\". it is also the second of three queen albums to feature in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you die. in 1975, the band left for a world tour with each member in zandra rhodes-created costumes and accompanied with banks of lights and effects. they toured the us as headliners, and played in canada for the first time. while the band toured japan in april, the band's manager, jim beach, successfully negotiated the band out of their trident studios contract. one of the options they considered was an offer from led zeppelin's manager, peter grant. grant wanted them to sign with led zeppelin's own production company, swan song records. the band found the contract unacceptable and instead contacted elton john's manager, john reid, who accepted the position. in late 1975, queen recorded and released a night at the opera, taking its name from the popular marx brothers movie. at the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. in \\\"the prophet's song\\\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. the mercury penned ballad, \\\"love of my life\\\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. the album was very successful in britain, and went triple platinum in the united states. the british public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 channel 4 poll. it has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an abc poll saw the australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.a night at the opera has frequently appeared in \\\"greatest albums\\\" lists reflecting the opinions of critics. among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in q magazine's \\\"the 50 best british albums ever\\\" in 2004, and number 11 in rolling stone's \\\"the 100 greatest albums of all time\\\" as featured in their mexican edition in 2004. it was also placed at no. 230 on rolling stone magazine's list of \\\"the 500 greatest albums of all time\\\" in 2003.a night at the opera is the third and final queen album to be featured in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you die. the album also featured the hit single \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\", which was number one in the uk for nine weeks and is the third-best-selling single of all time in the uk, surpassed only by band aid's \\\"do they know it's christmas?\\\" and elton john's \\\"candle in the wind 1997\\\"--making it the best selling commercial single in the uk. it also reached number nine in the united states (a 1992 re-release reached number two on billboard for five weeks). it is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions, and became the christmas number one twice in the uk, the only single ever to do so. bohemian rhapsody has been voted numerous times the greatest song of all time. the band decided to make a video to help go with the single and used trident's new technology ; the result is generally considered to have been the first \\\"true\\\" music video ever produced. although other bands, including the beatles, had made short promotional films or videos of songs prior to this, generally, those were specifically made to be aired on specific television shows. the second single from the album, \\\"you're my best friend\\\", the second song composed by john deacon, and his first single, peaked at number sixteen in the united states and went on to become a worldwide top ten hit. the band's a night at the opera tour began in november 1975, and covered europe, the united states, japan, and australia. \\n\\na day at the races to live killers (1976-1979):\\nby 1976, queen were back in the studio recording a day at the races, which is often regarded as a sequel album to a night at the opera. it again borrowed the name of a marx brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of a night at the opera, a variation on the same queen crest. the most recognisable of the marx brothers, groucho marx, invited queen to visit him in his los angeles home in march 1977, and the band thanked him in person, and performed \\\"'39\\\" a cappella. musically, a day at the races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the uk and japan, and number five in the us. the major hit on the album was \\\"somebody to love\\\", a gospel-inspired song in which mercury, may, and taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a 100-voice gospel choir. the song went to number two in the united kingdom, and number thirteen on the us singles chart. the album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, brian may's \\\"tie your mother down\\\", which became a staple of their live shows. during 1976, queen played one of their most famous gigs, a free concert in hyde park, london. it set an attendance record, with 150,000 people confirmed in the audience. on 1 december 1976, queen were the intended guests on london's early evening today programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, emi labelmate the sex pistols, give their seminal interview. during the a day at the races tour in 1977, queen performed sold-out shows at madison square garden, new york, in february, and earls court, london, in june. the band's sixth studio album news of the world was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the united states, and twice in the uk. the album contained many songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable anthems, \\\"we will rock you\\\" and the rock ballad \\\"we are the champions\\\", both of which became enduring international sports anthems, and the latter reached number four in the united states. queen commenced the news of the world tour in october 1977, and robert hilburn of the los angeles times called this concert tour the band's \\\"most spectacularly staged and finely honed show yet\\\". \\n\\nin 1978, the band released jazz, which included the hit singles \\\"fat bottomed girls\\\" and \\\"bicycle race\\\" on a double-sided record. the album reached number two in the uk and number six on the billboard 200 in the us. this album was \\\"the target of a bizarre marketing campaign, in which sixty-five naked women were perched atop bicycles rented from halford's cycles and sent racing around wimbledon stadium.\\\" reviews of the album in recent years have been more favourable. another notable track from jazz, \\\"don't stop me now\\\", provides another example of the band's exuberant vocal harmonies. in 1978, queen toured the us and canada, and spent much of 1979 touring in europe and japan. they released their first live album, live killers, in 1979; it went platinum twice in the united states. queen also released the very successful single \\\"crazy little thing called love\\\", a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of elvis presley. the song made the top 10 in many countries, topped the australian aria charts for seven consecutive weeks, and was the band's first number one single in the united states where it topped the billboard hot 100 for four weeks. having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record, mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert. in december 1979, queen played the opening night at the concert for the people of kampuchea in london, having accepted a request by the event's organiser paul mccartney. \\n\\nthe game to the works (1980-1984):\\n\\nqueen began their 1980s career with the game. it featured the singles \\\"crazy little thing called love\\\" and \\\"another one bites the dust\\\", both of which reached number one in the united states. after attending a queen concert in los angeles, michael jackson suggested to mercury backstage that \\\"another one bites the dust\\\" be released as a single, and in october 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. the album topped the billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the us. it was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a queen album. heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \\\"no synthesisers!\\\" sleeve note. the note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\\\"hard\\\"-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer roy thomas baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. in september 1980, queen performed three sold-out shows at madison square garden. in 1980, queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for flash gordon. in 1981, queen travelled to south america as part of the game tour, and became the first major rock band to play in latin american stadiums. the tour included five shows in argentina, one of which drew the largest single concert crowd in argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in buenos aires and two concerts at the morumbi stadium in s\\u00e3o paulo, brazil, where they played to an audience of more than 131,000 people in the first night (then the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world) and more than 120,000 people the following night. in october of the same year, queen performed for more than 150,000 fans on 9 october at monterrey (estadio universitario) and 17 and 18 at puebla (estadio zaragoza), mexico. on 24 and 25 november, queen played two sell out nights at the montreal forum, quebec, canada. one of mercury's most notable performances of the game's final track, \\\"save me\\\", took place in montreal, and the concert is recorded in the live album, queen rock montreal. queen worked with david bowie on the single \\\"under pressure\\\". the first-time collaboration with another artist was spontaneous, as bowie happened to drop by the studio while queen were recording. upon its release, the song was extremely successful, reaching number one in the uk and featuring at number 31 on vh1's 100 greatest songs of the '80s. later in 1981, queen released their first compilation album, titled greatest hits, which showcased the group's highlights from 1974-1981. it is the best-selling album in uk chart history, and has spent 450 weeks in the uk album chart. the album is certified eight times platinum in the united states, and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide. taylor became the first member of the band to release his own solo album in 1981, titled fun in space. \\n\\nin 1982, the band released the album hot space, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and r&b. most of the album was recorded in munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and taylor and may lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence mercury's personal manager paul prenter had on the singer. may was also scathing of prenter, who was mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations, such as the us networks, and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to mercury. the band stopped touring north america after their hot space tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on american television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of saturday night live. queen left elektra records, their label in the united states, canada, japan, australia, and new zealand, and signed onto emi/capitol records. after working steadily for over ten years, queen decided that they would not perform any live shows in 1983. during this time, they recorded a new album at the record plant studios, los angeles and musicland studios, munich, and several members of the band explored side projects and solo work. may released a mini-album titled star fleet project, on which he collaborated with eddie van halen. in february 1984, queen released their eleventh studio album, the works, which included the successful singles \\\"radio ga ga\\\", \\\"hammer to fall\\\" and \\\"i want to break free\\\". despite these hit singles, the album failed to do well in the united states, while in the uk it went triple platinum and remained in the album chart for two years. that year, queen began the works tour, the first tour to feature keyboardist spike edney as an extra live musician. the tour featured nine sold-out dates in bophuthatswana, south africa, at the arena in sun city. upon returning to england, they were the subject of outrage, having played there during the height of apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts. the band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in that country, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences. \\n\\nlive aid and later years (1985-1990):\\nin january 1985, the band headlined two nights of the first rock in rio festival at rio de janeiro, brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night. the boston globe described it as a \\\"mesmerising performance\\\". a selection of highlights of both nights was released on vhs with the title queen: live in rio, and was later broadcast on mtv in the us. in april and may 1985, queen completed the works tour with sold-out shows in australia and japan. \\n\\n\\\"queen were absolutely the best band of the day... they just went and smashed one hit after another... it was the perfect stage for freddie: the whole world\\\" \\n\\n --bob geldof, on queen's performance at live aid.\\nat live aid, held at wembley on 13 july 1985, in front of the biggest-ever tv audience of 1.9 billion, queen performed some of their greatest hits, during which the sold-out stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison. the show's organiser, bob geldof, other musicians such as elton john and dave grohl, and various music journalists commented that queen stole the show. an industry poll in 2005 named it the greatest rock performance of all time. when interviewed for mojo magazine the band said the most amazing sight at live aid was to see the audience clapping to \\\"radio ga ga\\\". brian may stated: \\\"i'd never seen anything like that in my life and it wasn't calculated either. we understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the (music) video. i remember thinking 'oh great, they've picked it up' and then i thought 'this is not a queen audience'. this is a general audience who've bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill. and they all did it. how did they know? nobody told them to do it.\\\" the band, now revitalised by the response to live aid -- a \\\"shot in the arm\\\" roger taylor called it, -- and the ensuing increase in record sales, ended 1985 by releasing the single \\\"one vision\\\", which was the first time since \\\"stone cold crazy\\\" that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song. also, a limited-edition boxed set containing all queen albums to date was released under the title of the complete works. the package included previously unreleased material, most notably queen's non-album single of christmas 1984, titled \\\"thank god it's christmas\\\". in early 1986, queen recorded the album a kind of magic, containing several reworkings of songs written for the fantasy action film highlander. the album was very successful, producing a string of hits, including the title track, \\\"a kind of magic\\\". also charting from the album were \\\"friends will be friends\\\", \\\"who wants to live forever\\\" (featuring an orchestra conducted by michael kamen), and the de facto theme from highlander, \\\"princes of the universe\\\". in summer of 1986, queen went on their final tour with freddie mercury. a sold-out tour in support of a kind of magic, once again they hired spike edney, leading to him being dubbed the unofficial fifth member. the magic tour's highlight was at wembley stadium in london and resulted in the live double album, queen at wembley, released on cd and as a live concert dvd, which has gone five times platinum in the us and four times platinum in the uk. queen could not book wembley for a third night, but they did play at knebworth park. the show sold out within two hours and over 120,000 fans packed the park for what was queen's final live performance with mercury. during the tour, queen performed a concert at slane castle, ireland, in front of an audience of 95,000, which broke the venue's attendance record. the band also played behind the iron curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 in budapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in eastern europe. more than one million people saw queen on the tour--400,000 in the united kingdom alone, a record at the time. after working on various solo projects during 1988 (including mercury's collaboration with montserrat caball\\u00e9, barcelona), the band released the miracle in 1989. the album continued the direction of a kind of magic, using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. it spawned the european hits \\\"i want it all\\\", \\\"breakthru\\\", \\\"the invisible man\\\", \\\"scandal\\\", and \\\"the miracle\\\".the miracle also began a change in direction of queen's songwriting philosophy. since the band's beginning, nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member, with other members adding minimally. with the miracle, the band's songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed to credit the final product only to queen as a group. \\n\\nmercury: illness, death, and tribute (1988-1992):\\n\\n\\\"there was all that time when we knew freddie was on the way out, we kept our heads down\\\" \\n\\n --brian may\\nafter fans noticed mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that mercury was suffering from aids. mercury flatly denied this, insisting he was merely \\\"exhausted\\\" and too busy to provide interviews. the band decided to continue making albums, starting with the miracle in 1989 and continuing with innuendo in 1991. despite his deteriorating health, the lead singer continued to contribute. for the last two albums made while mercury was still alive, the band credited all songs to queen, rather than specific members of the group, freeing them of internal conflict and differences. in 1990, mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of queen to collect the brit award for outstanding contribution to british music.innuendo was released in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 uk hit and other charting singles including, \\\"the show must go on\\\". mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded \\\"the show must go on\\\" in 1990. because of this, may had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it. recalling mercury's successful performance may states; \\\"he went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal\\\". the band's second greatest hits compilation, greatest hits ii, followed in october 1991, which is the eighth best-selling album of all time in the uk and has sold 16 million copies worldwide. on 23 november 1991, in a prepared statement made on his deathbed, mercury confirmed that he had aids. within 24 hours of the statement, he died of bronchial pneumonia, which was brought on as a complication of aids. his funeral service on 27 november in kensal green, west london was private, and held in accordance with the zoroastrian religious faith of his family. \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" was re-released as a single shortly after mercury's death, with \\\"these are the days of our lives\\\" as the double a-side. the music video for \\\"these are the days of our lives\\\" contain mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. the single went to number one in the uk, remaining there for five weeks - the only recording to top the christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992). initial proceeds from the single - approximately \\u00a31,000,000 - were donated to the terrence higgins trust. queen's popularity was stimulated in the united states when \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" was featured in the 1992 comedy film wayne's world. its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the billboard hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 (it remained in the hot 100 for over 40 weeks), and won the band an mtv award at the 1992 mtv video music awards. the compilation album classic queen also reached number four on the billboard 200, and is certified three times platinum in the us.wayne's world footage was used to make a new music video for \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\", with which the band and management were delighted. on 20 april 1992, the freddie mercury tribute concert was held at london's wembley stadium to a 72,000-strong crowd. performers, including def leppard, robert plant, guns n' roses, elton john, david bowie, george michael, annie lennox, seal, extreme, and metallica performed various queen songs along with the three remaining queen members. the concert is listed in the guinness book of records as \\\"the largest rock star benefit concert\\\", as it was televised to over 1.2 billion viewers worldwide, and raised over \\u00a320,000,000 for aids charities. \\n\\nmade in heaven to 46664 concert (1995-2003):\\n\\nqueen's last album featuring mercury, titled made in heaven, was finally released in 1995, four years after his death. it was constructed from mercury's final recordings in 1991, featuring tracks such as \\\"too much love will kill you\\\" and \\\"heaven for everyone\\\", plus material left over from their previous studio albums. in addition, re-worked material from may, taylor, and mercury's solo albums were included. both stages of recording, before and after mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in montreux, switzerland. the album reached no. 1 on the uk charts immediately following its release, and has sold 20 million copies worldwide. on 25 november 1996, a statue of mercury was unveiled in montreux overlooking lake geneva, almost five years to the day since his death. \\n\\n\\\"you guys should go out and play again. it must be like having a ferrari in the garage waiting for a driver\\\" \\n\\n --elton john, on queen being without a lead singer since the death of freddie mercury.\\nin 1997, queen returned to the studio to record \\\"no-one but you (only the good die young)\\\". it was released as a bonus track on the queen rocks compilation album later that year. the song was later released as a single, reaching number 13 in the uk chart. in january 1997, queen performed \\\"the show must go on\\\" live with elton john and the berjart ballet in paris on a night in which freddie mercury was remembered, and it marked the last performance and public appearance of john deacon, who chose to retire. the paris concert was only the second time queen had played live since mercury's death, and prompted elton john to urge them to perform again. brian may and roger taylor performed together at several award ceremonies and charity concerts, sharing vocals with various guest singers. during this time, they were billed as queen + followed by the name of the guest singer. in 1998, the duo appeared at luciano pavarotti's benefit concert with may performing \\\"too much love will kill you\\\" with pavarotti, later playing \\\"radio ga ga\\\", \\\"we will rock you\\\", and \\\"we are the champions\\\" with zucchero. they again attended and performed at pavarotti's benefit concert in modena, italy in may 2003. several of the guest singers recorded new versions of queen's hits under the queen + name, such as robbie williams providing vocals for \\\"we are the champions\\\" for the soundtrack of a knight's tale (2001). \\n\\nin 1999, a greatest hits iii album was released. this featured, among others, \\\"queen + wyclef jean\\\" on a rap version of \\\"another one bites the dust\\\". a live version of \\\"somebody to love\\\" by george michael and a live version of \\\"the show must go on\\\" with elton john were also featured in the album. by this point, queen's vast amount of record sales made them the second best selling artist in the uk of all time, behind the beatles. in 2002, queen were awarded the 2,207th star on the hollywood walk of fame, which is located at 6358 hollywood blvd. on 29 november 2003, may and taylor performed at the 46664 concert hosted by nelson mandela at green point stadium, cape town, in order to raise awareness of the spread of hiv/aids in south africa. may and taylor spent time at mandela's home, discussing how africa's problems might be approached, and two years later the band was made ambassadors for the 46664 cause. \\n\\nqueen + paul rodgers (2004-2009):\\n\\nat the end of 2004, may and taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with paul rodgers (founder and former lead singer of free and bad company). brian may's website also stated that rodgers would be \\\"featured with\\\" queen as \\\"queen + paul rodgers\\\", not replacing mercury. the retired john deacon would not be participating. in november 2004, queen were among the inaugural inductees into the uk music hall of fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which rodgers joined may and taylor as vocalist. between 2005 and 2006, queen + paul rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time queen toured since their last tour with freddie mercury in 1986. the band's drummer roger taylor commented; \\\"we never thought we would tour again, paul rodgers came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. paul is just such a great singer. he's not trying to be freddie.\\\" the first leg was in europe, the second in japan, and the third in the us in 2006. queen received the inaugural vh1 rock honors at the mandalay bay events center in las vegas, nevada, on 25 may 2006. the foo fighters paid homage to the band in performing \\\"tie your mother down\\\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by may, taylor, and paul rodgers, who played a selection of queen hits. \\n\\non 15 august 2006, brian may confirmed through his website and fan club that queen + paul rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in october, to be recorded at a \\\"secret location\\\". queen + paul rodgers performed at the nelson mandela 90th birthday tribute held in hyde park, london on 27 june 2008, to commemorate mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the hiv/aids pandemic. the first queen + paul rodgers album, titled the cosmos rocks, was released in europe on 12 september 2008 and in the united states on 28 october 2008. following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through europe, opening on kharkiv's freedom square in front of 350,000 ukrainian fans. the 12 september concert in ukraine was later released on dvd. the tour then moved to russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the moscow arena. having completed the first leg of its extensive european tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the uk leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three london dates, the first of which was the o2 arena on 13 october. the last leg of the tour took place in south america, and included a sold-out concert at the estadio jos\\u00e9 amalfitani, buenos aires. queen and paul rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 may 2009. rodgers stated: \\\"my arrangement with queen was similar to my arrangement with jimmy page in the firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement\\\". rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with queen again. \\n\\ndeparture from emi, 40th anniversary (2009-present):\\non 20 may 2009, may and taylor performed \\\"we are the champions\\\" live on the season finale of american idol with winner kris allen and runner-up adam lambert providing a vocal duet. in mid-2009, after the split of queen + paul rodgers, the queen online website announced a new greatest hits compilation named absolute greatest. the album was released on 16 november and peaked at number 3 in the official uk chart. the album contains 20 of queen's biggest hits spanning their entire career and was released in four different formats: single disc, double disc (with commentary), double disc with feature book, and a vinyl record. prior to its release, a competition was run by queen online to guess the track listing as a promotion for the album. on 30 october 2009, may wrote a fanclub letter on his website stating that queen had no intentions to tour in 2010 but that there was a possibility of a performance. he was quoted as saying, \\\"the greatest debate, though, is always about when we will next play together as queen. at the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. the good news, though, is that roger and i have a much closer mutual understanding these days--privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. music is never far away from us. as i write, there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the usa, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up this particular challenge. every day, doors seem to open, and every day, we interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside. it is a time of exciting transition in rock music and in 'the business'. it's good that the pulse still beats\\\". on 15 november 2009, may and taylor performed \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" live on the british tv show the x factor alongside the finalists. \\n\\n\\\"many of you will have read bits and pieces on the internet about queen changing record companies and so i wanted to confirm to you that the band have signed a new contract with universal music...we would like to thank the emi team for all their hard work over the years, the many successes and the fond memories, and of course we look forward to continuing to work with emi music publishing who take care of our songwriting affairs. next year we start working with our new record company to celebrate queen's 40th anniversary and we will be announcing full details of the plans over the next 3 months. as brian has already said queen's next moves will involve 'studio work, computers and live work\\\" \\n\\n --jim beach, queen's manager, on the change of record label.\\non 7 may 2010, may and taylor announced that they were quitting their record label, emi, after almost 40 years. on 20 august 2010, queen's manager jim beach put out a newsletter stating that the band had signed a new contract with universal music. during an interview for hardtalk on the bbc on 22 september, may confirmed that the band's new deal was with island records, a subsidiary of universal. for the first time since the late 1980s, queen's catalogue will have the same distributor worldwide, as their us home, hollywood records, is currently distributed by universal (for a time in the late 1980s, queen was on emi-owned capitol records in the us). on 14 march 2011, which marked the band's 40th anniversary, queen's first five albums were re-released in the uk and some other territories as remastered deluxe editions (the us versions were released on 17 may). the second five albums of queen's back catalogue were released worldwide on 27 june, with the exception of the us and canada (27 september). the final five were released in the uk on 5 september. in may 2011, jane's addiction vocalist perry farrell noted that queen are currently scouting their once former and current live bassist chris chaney to join the band. farrell stated: \\\"i have to keep chris away from queen, who want him and they're not gonna get him unless we're not doing anything. then they can have him.\\\" in the same month, paul rodgers stated he may tour with queen again in the near future. at the 2011 broadcast music, incorporated (bmi) awards held in london on 4 october, queen received the bmi icon award in recognition for their airplay success in the us. at the 2011 mtv europe music awards on 6 november, queen received the global icon award, which katy perry presented to brian may. queen closed the awards ceremony, with adam lambert on vocals, performing \\\"the show must go on\\\", \\\"we will rock you\\\" and \\\"we are the champions\\\". the collaboration garnered a positive response from both fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together. in october 2011, it was announced that queen will be recording a new album featuring lost demos of mercury on vocals. brian may confirmed that he and taylor are working their way through the band's old material to compile a selection of unreleased songs for the forthcoming album. may also revealed that a series of duets that mercury recorded with michael jackson are to be released in 2012. on 25 and 26 april, may and taylor appeared on the eleventh series of american idol at the nokia theatre, los angeles, performing a queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \\\"somebody to love\\\" with the 'queen extravaganza' band. queen were scheduled to headline sonisphere at knebworth on 7 july 2012 with adam lambert before the festival was cancelled. queen's final concert with freddie mercury was in knebworth in 1986. brian may commented, \\\"it's a worthy challenge for us, and i'm sure adam would meet with freddie's approval.\\\" queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. it was later announced that queen + adam lambert would play two shows at the hammersmith apollo, london on 11 and 12 july 2012. both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. a third london date was scheduled for 14 july. on 30 june, queen + lambert performed in kiev, ukraine at a joint concert with elton john for the elena pinchuk antiaids foundation. queen also performed with lambert on 3 july 2012 at moscow's olympic stadium, and on 7 july 2012 at the municipal stadium in wroclaw, poland. on 12 august 2012, queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 summer olympics in london. the performance at london's olympic stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of freddie mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at wembley stadium. following this, may performed part of the \\\"brighton rock\\\" solo before being joined by taylor and solo artist jessie j for a performance of \\\"we will rock you\\\". \\n\\nartistry:\\n\\nmusical style:\\n\\nthe band drew artistic influence from many other british rock acts at the time, such as the beatles, led zeppelin, pink floyd, the who, black sabbath, slade, deep purple and david bowie. queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. the genres they have been associated with include progressive rock,heavy metal,glam rock,hard rock,pop rock,dance/disco,blues rock and psychedelic rock. queen also wrote songs that were inspired by genres that are not typically associated with rock, such as ragtime, opera, gospel, vaudeville, and folk. in 1963, the teenage brian may and his father custom-built his signature guitar red special, which was purposely designed to feedback. sonic experimentation figured heavily in queen's songs. a distinctive characteristic of queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of may, mercury, and taylor best heard on the studio albums a night at the opera and a day at the races. some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer roy thomas baker, and their engineer mike stone. besides vocal harmonies, queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. for instance, according to brian may, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\". many queen songs were also written with audience participation in mind, such as \\\"we will rock you\\\" and \\\"we are the champions\\\". \\n\\ninfluence:\\nqueen have been recognised as having made significant contributions to such genres as hard rock, and heavy metal, amongst others. hence, the band have been cited as an influence by many other musicians. moreover, like their music, the bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by queen are diverse and span different generations, countries, and genres. some of the musicians that have cited the band as an influence include anthrax,nirvana,def leppard,dream theater,extreme,trivium,foo fighters,franz ferdinand,george michael,green day,guns n' roses,iron maiden,journey,kansas,katy perry,keane,lady gaga,manic street preachers,meat loaf,metallica,mika,muse,m\\u00f6tley cr\\u00fce,my chemical romance,panic at the disco,queensr\\u00ffche,van halen,radiohead,robbie williams,trent reznor,steve vai,sum 41,styx,the flaming lips,the killers, and the smashing pumpkins. queen have been cited as a major influence on the \\\"neo-classical metal\\\" genre by swedish guitarist yngwie malmsteen.metallica recorded a cover version of \\\"stone cold crazy\\\", which first appeared on the rub\\u00e1iy\\u00e1t: elektra's 40th anniversary album in 1990, and won their first grammy award for best metal performance in 1991. in the early 70s, queen helped spur the heavy metal genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; the new wave of british heavy metal in addition, they fused the music genre with a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. \\n\\nlegacy:\\nin 2002, queen's \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" was voted \\\"the uk's favourite hit of all time\\\" in a poll conducted by the guinness world records british hit singles book, and in 2004 the song was inducted into the grammy hall of fame. acclaimed for their stadium rock, in 2005 an industry poll ranked queen's performance at live aid in 1985 as the best live act in history. in 2007, they were also voted the greatest british band in history by bbc radio 2 listeners. as of 2005, according to the guinness book of world records, queen albums have spent a total of 1,322 weeks (twenty-six years) on the uk album charts, more time than any other musical act. also in 2005, with the release of their live album with paul rodgers, queen moved into third place on the list of acts with the most aggregate time spent on the british record charts. in 2006, the greatest hits album was the all-time best-selling album in uk chart history, with sales of 5,407,587 copies, over 604,295 more copies than its nearest competitor, the beatles' sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band. their greatest hits ii album is the eighth best seller, with sales of 3,746,404 copies. the band have released a total of eighteen number one albums, eighteen number one singles, and ten number one dvds worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. queen have sold over 150 million albums, with some estimates in excess of 300 million albums worldwide, including 34.5 million in the united states alone as of 2004. inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001, the band is also the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single, and all four members of queen were inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2003. in 2009, \\\"we will rock you\\\" and \\\"we are the champions\\\" were inducted into the grammy hall of fame, and the latter was voted the world's favourite song in a global music poll. queen are one of the most bootlegged bands ever, according to nick weymouth, who manages the band's official website. a 2001 survey discovered the existence of 12,225 websites dedicated to queen bootlegs, the highest number for any band. bootleg recordings have contributed to the band's popularity in certain countries where western music is censored, such as iran. in a project called queen: the top 100 bootlegs, many of these have been made officially available to download for a nominal fee from queen's website, with profits going to the mercury phoenix trust.rolling stone ranked queen at number 52 on its list of the \\\"100 greatest artists of all time\\\", while ranking mercury the 18th greatest singer, and may the twenty-sixth greatest guitarist. queen were named 13th on vh1's 100 greatest artists of hard rock list, and in 2010 were ranked 17th on vh1's 100 greatest artists of all time list. \\n\\nin other media:\\n\\nmusical theatre:\\n\\nin may 2002, a musical or \\\"rock theatrical\\\" based on the songs of queen, titled we will rock you, opened at the dominion theatre on london's west end. the musical was written by british comedian and author ben elton in collaboration with brian may and roger taylor, and produced by robert de niro. it has since been staged in many cities around the world. following the las vegas premiere on 8 september 2004, queen were inducted into the hollywood rockwalk in sunset boulevard, los angeles. the original london production was scheduled to close on saturday, 7 october 2006, at the dominion theatre, but due to public demand, the show has now been extended indefinitely. we will rock you has become the longest running musical ever to run at this prime london theatre, overtaking the previous record holder, the grease musical. brian may has confirmed that they are considering writing a sequel to the musical. the musical toured around the uk in 2009, playing at manchester palace theatre, sunderland empire, birmingham hippodrome, bristol hippodrome, and edinburgh playhouse. the launch of the musical coincided with queen elizabeth ii's golden jubilee. as part of the jubilee celebrations, brian may performed a guitar solo of \\\"god save the queen\\\", as featured on queen's a night at the opera, from the roof of buckingham palace. the recording of this performance was used as video for the same song on the 30th anniversary dvd edition of a night at the opera. sean bovim created \\\"queen at the ballet\\\", a tribute to freddie mercury, which uses queen's music as a soundtrack for the show's dancers, who interpret the stories behind tracks such as \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\", \\\"radio ga ga\\\", and \\\"killer queen\\\". queen's music also appears in the off-broadway production power balladz, most notably the song \\\"we are the champions\\\", with the show's two performers believing the song was \\\"the apex of artistic achievement in its day\\\". \\n\\ndigital realm:\\nin conjunction with electronic arts, queen released the computer game queen: the eye in 1998. the music itself--tracks from queen's vast catalogue, in many cases remixed into new instrumental versions--was by and large well received, but the game experience was hampered by poor gameplay. adding to the problem was an extremely long development time, resulting in graphic elements that already seemed outdated by the time of release. under the supervision of may and taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving queen's lengthy audio and video catalogue. dvd releases of their 1986 wembley concert (titled live at wembley stadium), 1982 milton keynes concert (queen on fire - live at the bowl), and two greatest video hits (volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band's music remixed into 5.1 and dts surround sound. so far, only two of the band's albums, a night at the opera and the game, have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on dvd-audio. a night at the opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (cd+dvd-video set). in 2007, a blu-ray edition of queen's previously released concerts, queen rock montreal & live aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p hd. queen have been featured multiple times in the guitar hero franchise: a cover of \\\"killer queen\\\" in the original guitar hero, \\\"we are the champions\\\", \\\"fat bottomed girls\\\", and the paul rodgers collaboration \\\"c-lebrity\\\" in a track pack for guitar hero world tour, \\\"under pressure\\\" with david bowie in guitar hero 5, \\\"i want it all\\\" in guitar hero: van halen, \\\"stone cold crazy\\\" in guitar hero: metallica, and \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" in guitar hero: warriors of rock. on 13 october 2009, brian may revealed there was \\\"talk\\\" going on \\\"behind the scenes\\\" about a dedicated queen rock band game. queen have also been featured multiple times in the rock band franchise: a track pack of 10 songs which are compatible with rock band, rock band 2, and rock band 3 (three of those are also compatible with lego rock band). their hit \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" was featured in rock band 3 with full harmony and keys support. the band also appeared in the video game lego rock band as playable lego avatars. in march 2009, sony computer entertainment released a queen branded version of the company's karaoke franchise, singstar. the game, which is available on playstation 2 and playstation 3, is titled singstar queen and has 25 songs on the ps3 and 20 on the ps2. \\\"we will rock you\\\" and other songs by queen also appear in dj hero. \\n\\nfilm and television:\\nqueen contributed music directly to the movies flash gordon (1980), with \\\"flash\\\" as the theme song, and highlander (the original 1986 film), with \\\"a kind of magic\\\", \\\"one year of love\\\", \\\"who wants to live forever\\\", \\\"hammer to fall\\\", and the theme \\\"princes of the universe\\\", which was also used as the theme of the highlander tv series (1992-1998). in the united states, \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" was re-released as a single in 1992 after appearing in the comedy film wayne's world. the single subsequently reached number two on the billboard hot 100 (with \\\"the show must go on\\\" as the first track on the single) and helped rekindle the band's popularity in north america. several films have featured their songs performed by other artists. a version of \\\"somebody to love\\\" was done by anne hathaway in the 2004 film ella enchanted. in 2006, brittany murphy also recorded a cover of the same song for the 2006 movie happy feet. in 2001, a version of \\\"the show must go on\\\" was performed by jim broadbent and nicole kidman in the movie musical moulin rouge!. the closing credits of a knight's tale, released in 2001, has a version of \\\"we are the champions\\\" performed by robbie williams and queen; the introduction to the same movie features we will rock you played by the medieval audience. \\\"we are the champions\\\" also features in the mighty ducks trilogy, chicken little (2005), and the 2008 film what happens in vegas. in 1992, the film gladiator featured snippets of \\\"we will rock you\\\" performed by warrant whereas their full version was released as a single. in 2004, \\\"don't stop me now\\\" was featured in the bar fight scene in the cult movie shaun of the dead, and \\\"you're my best friend\\\"

moon, during act 29, \\\"minako's rival, mio kuroki, is a transfer student?\\\", used \\\"i was born to love you\\\" in a volleyball game scene featuring the show's hero usagi tsukino/sailor moon. \\\"i was born to love you\\\" was used as the theme song of the japanese television drama pride on fuji television in 2004, starring takuya kimura and y\\u016bko takeuchi. the show's soundtrack also contained other songs by queen, including \\\"we will rock you\\\", \\\"we are the champions\\\", and \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\". since featuring in grosse pointe blank in 1997, \\\"under pressure\\\" has appeared in a number of comedies, such as 40 days and 40 nights in 2002 and ben stiller's 2007 film the heartbreak kid. \\\"don't stop me now\\\" has featured in the bbc television show top gear, and in 2005 the song was voted as \\\"the greatest driving song ever\\\" by the shows viewers. the song was also featured in fox's cartoon series american dad! during the first season episode \\\"roger 'n' me\\\" on fox on 23 april 2006. this was the first of three appearances of queen songs, the second being \\\"another one bites the dust\\\" in 42-year-old virgin and \\\"bicycle race\\\" in jack's back. keeping in the tradition (since season five) of naming each season's episodes after songs from a famous 1970s era rock band (led zeppelin for the fifth season, the who for the sixth, and the rolling stones for the seventh), the eighth and final season of that '70s show consisted of episodes named after queen songs. \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\" served as the season premiere. fox television show the simpsons has made storylines which have featured queen songs such as \\\"we will rock you\\\", \\\"we are the champions\\\" (both sung by homer), and \\\"you're my best friend\\\". \\\"we are the champions\\\" has also featured in south park episode \\\"stanley's cup\\\", season 5 of the sopranos (tony's ringtone), and the first season of malcolm in the middle. on 11 april 2006,

appeared on the show included \\\"bohemian rhapsody\\\", \\\"fat bottomed girls\\\", \\\"the show must go on\\\", \\\"who wants to live forever\\\", and \\\"innuendo\\\". brian may later criticised the show for editing specific scenes, one of which made the group's time with contestant ace young look negative, despite it being the opposite. taylor and may again appeared on the american idol season 8 finale in may 2009, performing \\\"we are the champions\\\" with finalists adam lambert and kris allen. on 15 november 2009, brian may and roger taylor appeared on the singing contest

just 4 girls, which set about producing a four-piece girl group, following the initial success of previous all-female popstars acts such as the no angels (2000) and monrose (2006). no stranger to popstars, leonore bartsch, who originates from cologne, had already taken part in the monrose season and was the last contestant to leave before the finale. in june and july 2008, over 2,300 hopefuls turned up to open auditions in dortmund, dresden, hamburg and rust which required both singing and dancing experience. the judges consisted of dancer and choreographer detlef soost, dutch singer loona and german rapper sido. danish singer kate hall served as this season's vocal coach. after numerous elimination rounds, sixteen candidates flew to sharm el sheik, egypt, where they intensified their training in singing, dancing, and fitness. in the end, twelve girls made it into the band house near munich, of which six started work on the band's debut album. beforehand, the top eight contestants, as popstars: just 4 girls, released the single i believe in x-mas promoted with a music video. leo, german-brazilian gabriella de almeida rinne, who originates from berlin, and victoria ulbrich, all managed to make it into the queensberry line-up prior to the season's live finale in hilversum, netherlands, with all of them having won special stage performances, even though victoria had had to go into hiatus for four weeks due to her mother's sudden death. fourth member, swiss-born, german-italian, antonella, was not announced until 18 december, when the show was resumed, based on her having sold most of her version of the group's debut album volume i (which had been released in three different versions, a week prior to the finale, and featuring one finalist each) and her winning a public televoting over fellow campaigners patricia ivanauskas and katharina kobert (kaykay). ironically, although each of the queensberry girls had already performed together with all of their future bandmates (varying from duets to quartets), at some point throughout the season, it had never happened that all four of them made up one working group together. however, a couple of times, three of the future band members were featured in one quartet, but then with either leo or antonella not being part of it. \\n\\n2008-2009: albums - volume 1 and on my own:\\n\\nwith the final members of the group in place, the quartet signed a recording contract with warner music group sub-label starwatch music. in january 2009, the album volume i was certified gold by the ifpi, and in february, the band released their first main single, a double a-single consisting of the ballad i can't stop feeling and their promotional song no smoke - a cover version of the 2008 record by canadian idol winner eva avila. the single has also been covered by nicki french. the song reached a moderate number 23 on the german singles chart, the lowest-chart peak for any popstars winner's debut single, while no smoke made it to the top thirty in switzerland based on downloads only. in february 2009, the band served as the official opening act of the pussycat doll's world domination tour in selected european countries such as austria, germany and the netherlands. in june the same year, a deluxe edition of volume i was released featuring additional tracks (including the too young single) and remixes. on 6 may 2009, it was announced that the group was working on its second studio album. the track list included their previous summer song-single called too young, the second album's first single hello (turn your radio on) and one song, which was performed live by former popstars - just 4 girls participant patricia, called scandalous. the album was released on 6 november 2009, with its promotional single hello (turn your radio on) released on 23 october 2009. this album was planned to be the band's first us-album. on 18 june 2010, the girls released two new songs as the soundtrack for the hanni und nanni movie, while their record contract with warner music in germany was discontinued. \\n\\n2010-present: line-up changes:\\non 7 july 2010, the group announced on its website that anto and vici had both departed from the group. 1 selina herrero, a german-spanish singer from bad kreuznach in germany, who first hit the german single charts in 2008 with don't be shy and you can't stop me, and ronja hilbig, a singer from hamburg, who had played the role of nala in the german version of the musical the lion king and had been a member of die lollipops, were brought in as new members. the first appearance of the new quartet was scheduled for 15 july 2010 on viva live. the group made plans to shoot a reality show called a day in the life of queensberry to be shown all over the usa. in october 2010, the group recorded its earlier single i can't stop feeling in spanish as yo no puedo vivir sin ti. the song, written by teemu brunila and kid crazy, and adapted for spanish by jos\\u00e9 valdes, was first performed on viva live. on 3 december 2010, queensberry announced it would make a label change and release an album in 2011. during spring and summer of 2011, the group performed throughout germany on their pink chocolate tour. the girls guest star on the album of german rapper kittykat, and featured on a single called no time for suckers in april 2012 it was announced that selina herrero left the band and went back to school. as well it was announced that the first single from the upcoming album will be released on june 1st 2012, and is called timeless . the album will be released during june 22, 2012\"]}, {\"permalink\": \"a-queens-story\", \"name\": \"A Queens Story\", \"updated_at\": \"2012-08-28T07:22:34\", \"profiles\": {\"twitter\": [], \"myspace\": [], \"facebook\": [], \"soundcloud\": [], \"discogs\": []}, \"urls\": [], \"images\": null, \"musicbrainz_id\": null, \"channel_url\": \"http://api.shuffler.fm/v1/channels/artist:A%20Queens%20Story?api-key=<api-key>\", \"id\": 164364, \"biography\": []}, {\"permalink\": \"queen-of-hell-preview-rough-mix\", \"name\": \"Queen of Hell Preview (Rough Mix)\", \"updated_at\": \"2012-08-30T00:37:41\", \"profiles\": {\"twitter\": [], \"myspace\": [], \"facebook\": [], \"soundcloud\": [], \"discogs\": [\"legionz+ov+hell\"]}, \"urls\": [\"http://www.geocities.com/legionzovhell\", \"http://www.discogs.com/artist/legionz+ov+hell\"], \"images\": null, \"musicbrainz_id\": null, \"channel_url\": \"http://api.shuffler.fm/v1/channels/artist:Queen%20of%20Hell%20Preview%20%28Rough%20Mix%29?api-key=<api-key>\", \"id\": 165222, \"biography\": []}, {\"permalink\": \"kissy-sell-out-feat-queen-of-hearts\", \"name\": \"Kissy Sell Out (Feat.

[\"the jungle brothers are an american hip hop group that pioneered the fusion of jazz and hip-hop and also became the first hip-hop group to use a house-music producer. the group began performing in the mid-1980s and released its first album, straight out the jungle, in july 1988. with afrocentric lyrics and innovative beats, the jungle brothers were critically acclaimed and soon joined the influential native tongues collective. the original trio comprised michael small (mike gee), nathaniel hall (afrika baby bam, a homage to afrika bambaataa) and sammy burwell (dj sammy b). sammy b left the group after the group released raw deluxe in may 1997. \\n\\nhistory:\\ntheir first album, straight out the jungle, was released on an independent record label (warlock). the single \\\"i'll house you,\\\" added to the album in 1989, is known for being the first hip-house record recorded outside of the chicago scene, which was a club hit that drastically changed the way the hip-hop and dance-music industries worked. in spite of the commercial failure of straight out the jungle, warner bros. records soon signed the group and released done by the forces of nature in january 1990. the album was a critical smash at the time, though it has since been largely ignored by hip-hop critics in favor of the similarly acclaimed alternative hip-hop album 3 feet high and rising by de la soul, released the same year. also in 1990, the jungle brothers contributed the song \\\"i get a kick\\\" to the cole porter tribute album \\\"red hot + blue\\\" produced by the red hot organization. following a four year break, the jungle brothers returned in 1993 with j beez wit the remedy, another commercial disappointment. their next album, v.i.p. was produced by alex gifford of propellerheads and, during production, they found time to add their vocal stylings to the propellerheads tracks \\\"take california (and party)\\\" and \\\"you want it back\\\". their latest album to contain any new releases is 2002's all that we do. in 2001, their song \\\"what's the five 0\\\" was featured in the music video game frequency. in 2004, the jungle brothers joined with british producer mr on to produce \\\"breathe (don't stop)\\\", a version of \\\"breathe and stop\\\" by q-tip of a tribe called quest, combined with a sample of michael jackson's \\\"don't stop 'til you get enough\\\" (the idea was taken from a bootleg remix combining vocals from \\\"breathe and stop\\\" and music from \\\"don't stop 'til you get enough\\\"). in 2005, the jungle brothers released a greatest hits and classic remixes and rarities double album, this is..., which included remixes by the wiseguys, urban takeover, natural born chillers and stereo mcs. presently, their status as a group is in question, as mike g and sammy b are touring (sammy b also toured as fellow native tongues member black sheep dres' dj), and afrika baby bam now goes by b.a.m. and has a new movement called pagan society. in an interview with allhiphop.com, b.a.m. expressed his discontent with today's rap music industry. b.a.m. also stated his disappointment in pos (de la soul) and q-tip (a tribe called quest) in a vibe magazine article, saying that they are the reason that a full-fledged native tongue reunion has not transpired. in 2008, their single \\\"what u waitin 4\\\" was ranked number 88 on vh1's 100 greatest
